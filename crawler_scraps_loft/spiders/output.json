[Fluffy shouts] Houston! [crowd cheering] [audience] Five, four, three, two, one! [cheering]", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho man ♪", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho! ♪", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho man ♪", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho! ♪", "How are you?", "[crowd roars]", "[Fluffy] Whoo! Oh, man! That’s a long walk. [laughter] Thank you so much, Houston. [crowd cheering] One year ago, this city was flipped upside down by a hurricane, un cabrón named Harvey. [laughter] And they said that this city would never be the same. I think it’s beautiful that, a year later, we’re all here celebrating together the fact that this city is resilient. And you guys persevered. Houston’s strong, baby. [crowd cheering, applauding] That’s serious. In all sincerity, guys, I’m not trying to kiss your ass. I already got your money. [laughter] Freaking Houston. I love this town. I’ve been coming here for 20 years. Twenty years. Started off performing at a comedy club called The Last Stop. [cheering] And then, of course, we jumped over to the Improv, and then– I performed everywhere. I even did a one-nighter in Tomball. [laughter] That’s a long story for the people at home. I won’t even get into that. I want to give you guys a heads-up and let you know now that tonight I feel extra comfortable. You’re going to notice that you might hear a little bit more Spanish than you normally would. And you can’t do that just anywhere, but you can do that in Houston. [cheering and applause] Now, to everyone watching at home who is freaking out, like, “Oh, my God! I didn’t sign up for this.” [laughter] If I say something in Spanish, my promise is to translate immediately so that everyone enjoys the show. Okay? ‘Cause I know the second I said Spanish, people are freaking out, you know. All the people that drove in from the woodlands are like, “Hey!” [laughter] And for everyone at home, what does he mean by that, the people from the woodlands? You know. [laughter] [South Texas accent] “I know he is not referring to us.” [laughter] “The nerve of him!” “He needs to go back where he came from, over by Airline Road.” [laughter] [cheering] That’s right. I know where you keep your brown people. [laughter] This is awesome. This always pisses off Netflix. They’re like, “Gabriel, we really wish you would just do a show that’s general, that everybody understands. Why do you have to make your show so personal? Only people in that city are going to get it.” Well, when you have an arena full of people, you want them to get it. You want that extra personal special touch. I don’t care what they say. I already got the check. [laughter] Ha!", "So let me give you a heads-up as to what has happened since the last time I did a special. Um, my son, ", ", is now 19 years old. Nineteen years old, high school graduate, he has all his shots… Ladies? People tell me all the time. “Why do you talk about your son so much?” Because he won’t leave. [laughter] “Does he like it when you talk about him?” I said, “No, he hates it.” “Why do you do it?” “‘Cause he won’t leave.” [laughter] I’ll tell you what he likes to do right now. He likes to sit around the house and watch videos of other kids playing video games. See, some of you are clapping. I didn’t know that was an actual thing. I asked him, “What are you doing?” “I’m watching other kids playing video games.” I said, “That’s– Really? Why?” “Well, they’re professionals.” I’m like, “Why would you watch something that you could be doing?” “‘Cause they’re professionals.” “That’s dumb.” “Really, Dad? Every Sunday I see you watching football. [crowd ooh’s] How come you don’t play?” I don’t even argue. I just cut off the Internet. [laughter] My son’s problem right now is that he has, according to him, too many options. Okay? That’s his problem. I’m like, “Poor guy!” “I have so many options, Dad. I don’t know what to do.” Write them down. Put them on a wheel. Freaking– [mimics spinning wheel] Today: plumber. [laughter] Something! The problem is we go places, people find out he is my son and then they offer him opportunities. He doesn’t understand that that’s not how the real world works. I know about struggling and clawing, and fighting for the opportunity to do something. He doesn’t get it yet. And that’s my fault.", "For example, I take him and his mom out to dinner, okay? I took them both to ", ". Now, Houston. Me, personally, I love Red Lobster, okay? And not even for the seafood. I’m talking about the biscuits. [cheering] Oh, yeah. [vocalizes] It’s real good. [laughter] So we’re sitting there, and we’re having a conversation with our son about life, opportunity, what does he want to do with himself… And as we’re talking to him, the manager from Red Lobster walks over to our table. And he’s being really cool, right? He’s like, “Hey!” And I’m like, “Hey!” He looks at my son, “Is this the infamous Frankie?” And I say, “Why, yes, it is! He just graduated.” “Congratulations!” “And he’s looking for a job.” The manager goes, “Oh, say no more.” And he gives my son a business card and then he starts to say, “Listen, Frankie, this is all you have to do. Just go online and fill out the application. Once it’s registered, call me personally and I’ll see to it that you get an interview. The only position we have available right now is for a host, but there’s plenty of room for opportunity here at Red Lobster. Besides, you got one hell of a reference.” And then he walked away and I was like, “Oh, my God. I’m going to get free biscuits!” [laughter] My son looks at me and says, “I don’t want to work at Red Lobster.” I said, “Frankie, no one is making you work anywhere. This is just another opportunity that you’re wasting. Okay. No Red Lobster. What’s your plan?” “I don’t know.” I got frustrated. So I raised my voice. “Well, you better start thinking.” His mom didn’t like that. “Don’t talk to him like that.” I said, “Look, biscuit blocker…” [laughter] See, up to this point we have agreed on how we raise our son. But in this situation, she’s trying to protect him from the world. I’m trying to prepare him for the world. If he cannot handle me raising my voice to get his attention to see the bigger picture, he’s not ready for a world that doesn’t care about his feelings. [crowd whooping, applauding]", "So I said, “You know what? I got to have a one-on-one with him. I got to have a one-on-one with, uh–” [evil laugh] So I take him out to the movies. I take him out to the movies, we get in the car, we take off. [mimics car engine] A little 20-minute drive, okay? As we’re driving I figure I’ll have a little one-on-one with him. Maybe this way it doesn’t feel like a talk talk. I thought he understood what I was trying to say. It’s late. We’re leaving the movies. We’re pulling out of the parking structure and out of the corner of my eye, I see a cop car. And I made a sound, I was like, “Ugh!” And Frankie goes, “What is it, Dad?” I say, “There’s a cop at the light.” “What are you worried about?” “He’s going to stop us.” “How do you know?” “Watch.” [laughter] I made that left turn… [mimics engine and siren chirping] Frankie’s losing it. “It’s happening!” I said, “Relax.” I pull over. [mimics tires screeching] Cop pulls up from behind. [mimics tires screeching] Immediately. [knock-knock] “Driver, windows down.” [groans] [mimics window whirring down] “Driver, hands out the window.” Serious? [laughter] “Both of them.” “I can’t, I’m fat!” [laughter] He gets to the window, and he’s got the flashlight. And he shines the light right in my face. He’s like, “License.” “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.” He takes the license and then, of course, you know, “Do you know why I stopped you?” “Officer, no, I don’t, but I’m sure you’re about to tell me.” “You don’t have a front plate on your car.” I said, “Officer, you’re absolutely right. I do not have a front plate on my car, but my name is actually on the front of the car.” “Excuse me?” “My name is on the front of the car.” I own a 2012 Ford Flex and the Ford Flex has the actual word “flex” written on the hood. I have a friend who does custom automotive work and he took all the letters off the car except for the letter F, and he made letters so that it spells “Fluffy” on the hood. Okay? Yeah. -It sounds impressive. -[crowd whooping] You can do it too for like $23. It’s not that bad. They’re like refrigerator magnets. You can even move them. Like, one day a letter flew off and it said “Fuffy”. [laughter] Que pendejo. I know, stupid, right? So… The officer walks around to the front of the car and he takes his flashlight and he shines the light right on the hood, and he does this, he goes, “I knew it!” And my son goes, “What does that mean?” I said, “That means we get to go.” Oh, Houston, for the first time in a long time, my son was actually impressed by something that I did. You got to figure. This is not impressive to my son. Because he grew up in this environment.", "Okay, this does– You saw that, right? I saw like a– [laughter] That’s like the third one I’ve seen! This stuff keeps– [chuckles] People upstairs from Tomball, “Keep talking.” [laughter] Alright, I’ll tell you guys what happened. Shakira performed here a few days ago. And Shakira has an amazing show, okay? She doesn’t just come out and… [ululates] [humming “Whenever, Wherever” by Shakira] ♪ Together, together ♪ [indistinct] [crowd cheering] I think I just hurt myself. [laughter] But there’s a part of her show, where all of a sudden it was… [puffing] And there’s cannons with confetti that shoot everywhere, right? And I think that was left-over Shakira. [laughter] Can we edit out the part where I burned 800 calories? [laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Oh, my God! So, where was I? Oh! This. Does nothing for my son. and the reason why I say that is because he grew up in this environment. He’s been to a thousand shows. He’s seen me on TV a million times. It’s not a big deal, but the fact that I got stopped by a cop and the cop recognized me and geeked out and let us go, I earned street cred with my kid! [laughter] Yeah, Frankie was like, “That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen!” And I’m like, “Hell, yeah, cos’. That’s right. You better recognize, player.” [laughter] [mimics engine turning over] We get home, he woke up his mom! “Mom, you should’ve seen it! We got stopped by the cops!” “Are you okay?” “Yeah! They recognized Dad and they let us go.” She stayed quiet and I told her, “Huh? I got recognized!” And she said, “Ah!” [laughter]", "So my son, what he likes to do now, like I said, Frankie likes to stay home and watch videos. I come downstairs one morning and he’s on his phone, but the chair that he’s sitting in is turned, facing the window, which I thought was weird. So I called to him, “Frankie, what are you doing?” Nothing. So he can’t hear– “Frankie!” He can’t hear. So I walked up from behind, and I realized that my son has little headphones. That’s– Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, he’s not ignoring me. So I look over his shoulder, and I realize that my son is watching a film. [crowd ooh’s] And I don’t mean Frozen. [laughter] But those people look cold. [laughter] So now I’m standing there watching it with him. I’m not trying to bond or anything. I’m just trying to figure out the conversation I need to have and now we’re both watching professionals. [laughter] So I grabbed his headphone and I went… “Hey, is that a good movie?” And he freaked out! [screams] And he threw the phone. The phone came partially undone and you could hear it. Oh, it was bad. “Not my face, not my face, not my face.” He turned bright red and he starts walking back over. “How embarrassing. How long have you been standing there?” I said, “Long enough to know ‘not my face.'” [laughter] “Are you going to tell my mom?” I said, “Frankie, I love you way too much to do that to you. I would never tell your mom. I’mma tell everybody else.” [laughter] [laughs] Hey, don’t tell his mom. [laughter] I said, “Look, I know you’re not going to stop watching stuff like this. So just do me a favor. Don’t do this here. You’re old enough now to watch whatever you want to watch. But as long as you live in this house, you cannot be watching stuff like that where your mom can catch you. You’re not going to stop, so just don’t do it here.” “How do you know I’m not gonna stop?” “‘Cause I haven’t stopped. [laughter] Matter of fact, there’s a sequel to that. [laughter] It’s called Not my hair.” He said to me, “Que cochino!” I know right? [panting] I said, “Frankie, you’re going to watch stuff like that, just go in your room. Lock your door. I don’t want to catch you. Okay, so let me know.” “Want me to text you?” Never mind. [laughter]", "I’m in the middle of trying to deal with this whole situation with my son watching these videos and not going to work, and while I’m doing this, I get the most random phone call I’ve ever gotten. My publicist calls me up and she’s like, “Gabe! ", " is looking for you.” -“Excuse me?” -“Snoop Dogg, you know–” “I know who Snoop Dogg is! What do you mean, he’s looking for me?” “Well, he’s looking–” “Is he looking for me or is he looking for me?” “He’s a fan and he wants to interview you.” “Oh, cool! Sounds good. What is it?” “I think it’s some type of podcast.” “I’m in. Can I bring Frankie?” “Absolutely.” “Cool.” So I hang up the phone. I’m excited. I want to tell my son. I’m like, “Frankie! I’m walking towards your room.” [laughter] I’ll be at your door in three, two, one. Hey! Alright, you’re dressed. Good. Come on, let’s go. “Where are we going?” “Watch.” We get in the car. [mimics engine] And now we’re off on this adventure to go do an interview with Snoop Dogg. You guys, let me tell you something. We get to the neighborhood and we’re lost. The GPS says we’re there, but we’re lost. We’re looking for a house, and there’s no house, just a big building. And so I’m like, “This doesn’t look– A podcast? Really?” So I pull up to the security gate. [mimics engine, tires screeching] Tap the button on the wall. [beep, line trilling] “Security desk. Can I help you?” Hey, Security Desk. My name is Gabriel Iglesias. I think I’m here to do an interview with Snoop Dogg. “Okay, one moment.” Oh, okay, this is it. Good, good. I’m so excited. Snoop Dogg! It’s gonna be cool, right? [laughter] “Sir?” “Yes?” “Yes, hi, there’s no Gilbert Ignazios on file.” What? “Could it be another name?” “Another name? I don’t know. Fluffy, maybe?” [beep] And the gate starts to open. [laughter] I’m like, “Oh, my God, I’m officially in the rappers’ world because my real name doesn’t mean shit!” [laughter] So we drive in. [mimics engine] And we’re passing all of these reserved parking spaces. Reserved, reserved, reserved, reserved. And we get to my space, which is basically an orange cone that has “Fluffy” handwritten on it. And a bunch of other names crossed off. [laughs] So Frankie moves the cone. I park the car. [vocalizes] We walk into the building. My publicist is waiting for me, right? She’s like, “Gabe! You made it. Frankie, how are you? Listen. I just finished talking to Snoop. [sighs]", "Wow. He is everything you think he is and just a little bit more. He is so sweet. I cannot believe he was charged with double murder.” [laughter] “He told me to just walk you guys into the studio and he’ll be right back. He said he had to go outside and get in the right headspace or something…” “Okay, cool.” So she walks us into Snoop’s studio. I’m thinking I’m there for a podcast, come to find out it’s for a TV show. Snoop has a TV show where he interviews celebrities. Everyone in the room is waiting for Snoop to return. You can hear the small talk. [indistinct babbling, giggling] [crowd laughs] All of a sudden, everyone stands up and I’m looking around like, “What’s going on?” And I look at the door to see if Snoop’s walking in and I don’t see him and I could see my son. “Dad!” [muffled screaming] I don’t realize it, but Snoop is entering the room through a different door. I don’t realize it till, like, the last second. I’m like, “What do you–” So I jump up, I push in my chair. I’m so nervous, I don’t know how to address him. So I’m like… [laughter] I felt stupid. “Hi.” [laughter] Snoop walks over to me and he’s so cool, you guys. He’s so cool. He walks over to me and he grabs my hand. He’s really strong. He pulls me in and he says, “Yo, what it do, baby boo, how you feel?” [laughter, applause] “Thank you for having me.” “Yeah.” -“Can I sit down?” -“For sure.” [mimics chair] I sit down, I look over, I see my son. My son’s like… [laughter] The difference between Snoop’s show versus any other talk show I’ve ever done is that usually there’s a person, like a producer or a director who comes to you and gives you information, like how the show begins, topics you’re going to cover, how you go to commercial, how you come back from commercial… I’ve spoken to no one. Snoop just starts talking and at some point, they hit “Record.” I’m waiting for “Action!” or a buzzer. [mimics buzzer] Something! Snoop just starts talking to me. “Yo, what up, big Fluff?” “Big Fluff? Oh, that’s– Hey!” [laughter] “Yo, you like music?” “Snoop, I love music. I love your music.” “Yeah, that’s what’s up.” He opens up a laptop computer and then he hits “play.” And the next thing I know, we are listening to hardcore Mexican banda music. I mean hardcore. [vocalizing] And you can hear gunshots in the song. [laughter] [humming, mimics gunshots] [humming, mimics gunshots] [humming] And then a cow. [moos] [laughter] And the whole time Snoop is like, “I love it when he go moo.” [laughter] What? I feel like he’s messing with me because I’m Mexican, right? So I called him out. I said, “Snoop. Do you understand what you’re listening to?” And he said this, and it’s scared me. He said, “Gangster recognize gangster.” [crowd ooh’s] The reason why it scared me was because he was telling the truth. We were listening to actual Mexican cartel songs that don’t play on the radio. And the fact that he knew that, the fact that his level of street knowledge in another language was that on point, I said, “I gotta shut the hell up.” [laughter] Don’t speak unless spoken to. That’s the code. Next thing I know, Snoop reaches under the desk and he pulls out the biggest blunt I have ever seen. [crowd gasps] Oh, this sucker was huge. As soon as he pulled out that freaking blunt, got excited because I wanted to grab my cell phone. Okay, I wanted to grab my cell phone so that I could take a selfie of Snoop in the background being Snoop. So while I’m fumbling trying to get my phone, Snoop starts talking to me again. “Yo, Big Fluff?” Yeah, what? “Hit that while I hit this.” [laughter] The second I went like that, all of the cameras in the room: red light. Red light. Red light. Red light. Red light. My publicist is like, “No!” My son is like, “Yeah!” And now I’m being faced, bro. I’m being faced with a serious situation, because, you know, I’ve talked about friends participating and doing stuff like this, but I’ve never openly talked about myself… You know… And now I realized that from this moment forward, people are going to know what happened here with Snoop. So I started trying to find ways to justify it to myself. You know… If you’re going to do something like this on camera, you want it to be with Snoop. [laughter] You want it to be with Snoop, Cheech and Chong… [crowd cheering] …or Willie Nelson. [crowd cheering] Next thing I know, the manager hands me a lighter. I light it and I take a big hit. [sucking] So listen, I’m doing my best to hold in all this smoke, because I don’t want to look like a punk in front of Snoop Dogg. I’m trying, I’m fighting, bro. It’s hard, you know. [holding cough in] [laughter] The whole time Snoop is like, “Hell, yeah. That’s what I’m saying. Fluffy going puffy today.” [laughter] I do not remember the rest of the interview. What I remember is my buddy Anthony telling Snoop Dogg and I to stand up for a picture. “Stand up, get up for a picture.” And so Snoop and I both stand up to take this picture. I put my arm around him. I have to put my arm around him because he’s much taller than me, okay? Snoop has me by at least five inches. Shut up, alright? [laughs] [crowd cheering] You guys are laughing at the wrong jokes! [laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Bow-wow! [laughter] [low-pitched] Bow-wow. Everybody’s like, “This is a family show!” Well, apparently, that’s how families are made. That was too funny, sir. That was too funny. It’s sad how hard she laughed at that as she looked right at you. [laughter] I said, “Snoop has me by at least five inches,” and she’s like… [shrieks] Almost like she wasn’t even laughing at me. She was like laughing at you. So apparently you guys have some story that I just reignited. And now it’s awkward for all the kids. [laughter]", "So anyway… Snoop and I are taking photos, and then I can hear my son. “Dad! Dad!” [gasps] “Oh! Um, Snoop, can my son take a photo with you?” “Yeah.” “Get over here!” And so Frankie runs up, you guys, and he’s so cute, because he’s geeking out really hard. He’s like… [laughter] “Snoop, this is my son, Frankie. Frankie, say hello to Snoop.” And Snoop looks at me, and he’s so cool, Snoop is like… “Yo, this your kid? What up, Baby Fluff?” [laughter] And Frankie’s like… [laughter] “I don’t like that name.” “That’s too bad. Get a job, go. Go.” So Snoop and Frankie go into the corner to take pictures. Meanwhile, I walk back over to the desk, because I want to grab the sheet that has Snoop’s name and my name on it. I want to have Snoop autograph it so that I can frame it and put it on my wall. While I’m doing that, Frankie walks up from behind me and he whispers in my ear, trying to be all cool. “Dad! Dad!” “Huh? What? What?” “Dad, would it be okay if I finish smoking that with Snoop?” [laughter] Now I am being faced with the biggest moral decision of my life. And I’m high. And my mind is racing a thousand miles an hour. I’m like, “Should I let him, should I not? Am I a good dad, am I a bad dad? What’s his mom gonna think? I need a Snickers.” I’m just– And then I thought about it. “You know… Frankie, you’re over 18. Technically, you don’t have to ask me if you don’t want to, so as far as I’m–” [laughter] “Where’d you go?” A minute later, I am recording my son in a cloud with Snoop Dogg. [crowd cheering] And then I sent the video to his mom. [laughter] Hashtag biscuit blocker. Yes, I did. [laughter] Now, did this actually happen? Yes, it did. You can go online and watch the video on YouTube. Punch in “Snoop Dogg”, next to that put “Fluffy” or “Gabriel” and you can see the whole thing. Let me know how it turns out. [laughter] The fact that I got to meet Snoop was awesome. He looked for me. But every now and then, I go out and I want to meet people, I want to see cool things. For example, comedy. I’m a huge fan of comedy. Not just performing it. But I love going to shows. I go to a comedy show every now and then, alone. Now, I don’t know if that sounds weird to you guys, but for me to do anything nowadays by myself… It’s my crew. All the people that work for me, they freak out when I go places. They’re always concerned for my safety. “What if someone tries to kidnap you?” [laughter] Well, they’re going to earn it. [laughter] I got into a fight with some of my team members and I said, “You know what? I’m going out.”", "I bought myself a ticket and I went to go watch ", ", one night, in concert. [crowd cheering] Now, I says, “You know what? Maybe I can make my way backstage and, I don’t know, if I get lucky, maybe I’ll say hi to him. I’ve always wanted to meet him.” So I go to the side of the stage and I run into security. And I said, “Hey!” He looked at me and said, “Fluffy!” When he did that, I said, “Hey, listen, I forgot my keys, I’ll be right back.” And the guy’s like, “Yeah, keep going, get your keys.” I’m like, “Oh, my God, that shit worked!” [laughter] Just like that, I snuck backstage at a Chris Rock concert. Once I was behind the curtain, I was in my element. I knew where everything was. I knew where the food was, I knew where the dressing rooms were, where the bathrooms were… I’m walking around with a soda, people are coming up to me. “We didn’t know you were going to be here.” “I got a call last minute.” [laughter] “Looking for my keys.” [laughter] I says, “You know what, I got this far. I’m going to push it. I want to meet him.” I’ve always wanted to meet Chris Rock. It was not hard. Once I was back there, I just had to go to the dressing rooms. All I had to do was read the name on the door. I’m standing there, in front of the door, and I’m hyperventilating. [panting] [mimics knocking] The door opens up and there’s this man in there, this bodyguard who’s just massive. I’m a big guy, but damn, he was huge! As soon as he opened the door… [low-pitched growl] [mimics whooshing] [roaring] For real. Welcome to Jurassic– Big! Grandote. And I’m standing there and I’m like… “Hi.” And he’s like, “Can I help you?” “Yes, my name is Gabriel, I’m a comedian. And I wanted to see if I could say hi to Chris Rock if that’s possible.” “You say you comedian?” “Yes.” “Well, then you understand Chris is going over his material right now. He really ain’t trying to talk to nobody. So I’ll tell you what, player, if you want to come by after the show, You’re more than welcome to, but right now it’s not a good time. Chris Rock is a busy man.” [clicks tongue, sighs] [laughter] “Can I wave?” “Excuse me?” “Can I wave?” “What you mean?” “Can I wave to Chris? I don’t have to come in. Can I wave?” Chris Rock is in the room. He can hear the stupid conversation that’s taking place. [laughter] I know this because I can hear Chris Rock in the background. “What’s going on? Who’s at the door? Move out the way.” “Yo, Chris, I got this, man. I got this.” “Move!” “Alright.” The guy stands to the side. And now I’m looking at Chris Rock. And he recognized me. And it freaked me out. Oh, yeah, it freaked me out. He’s like, “Oh, shit! Look who it is. Look who it is. It’s the king of the Mexicans.” [laughter] Chris Rock called me the king of the Mexicans. For the rest of the show, everyone referred to me as “El Chapo.” I was celebrating the fact that I got away with that for so long. For so long! “I snuck backstage at Chris Rock! I snuck backstage, I snuck–“", "Until Karma showed up one day, in the form of the most extreme fan I have ever had in 20 years of me being a comedian. I had someone who not only made it backstage. This person paid to get into my dressing room. Okay? Yeah. He didn’t pay me, by the way. He didn’t pay me. I’m an honest hoe. Okay? I made no money that day, alright? If I had gotten paid, you wouldn’t be hearing this story. Here’s the thing. I walk into my dressing room from the bathroom. I just finished showering up and I’m in a towel. I walk into the room, come to find out later that this man was a very wealthy businessman in the community, okay? And when I walked into the room, he’s wearing a very, very nice suit. So when I saw the suit, I didn’t give it a second thought, because he looked professional. I thought maybe he was the general manager of the building, one of the concert promoters, he could have been someone’s agent… So when I walked in the room, in my towel, right, “Can I help you?” He looks at me and it was the most uncomfortable conversation I have ever had. He looks at me and says, “Listen. [inhales deeply, exhales] [laughter] I am not here to waste any of your time. Fluffy, I am prepared to take care of you. I will give you a new Lexus. And an allowance that’s more than what you make as a comedian. Leave with me.” [laughter] I was never more disgusted and offended at the fact that I was not gay. [laughter] Because finally! Finally, somebody wants to take care of me. [cheering, applause] Do you know how many people I take care of? No one’s ever offered me a Lexus, and they should. I felt horrible saying no to this guy. I still think about it. [laughter] I still have the number. [laughter]", "Houston, I’m going to tell you something, and I don’t know how this is going to go over, but I’m going to say it. I would be an amazing gay partner. [laughter] I would! All the way up until that one part, but even then. [laughter] Have you ever driven a Lexus? [laughter] Those are nice! Sometimes you got to take one for your own team. I’m just saying. [laughter] Now, in all seriousness, not to be funny, not to be disrespectful, let me tell you the reason why I would be an amazing gay partner. The level, the level of communication between two men is so high, I might actually get an answer. There might be clarity and understanding. I might hear a yes, I might hear a no. Do you know how many relationships I have been in where I still don’t know the outcome to certain conversations? [laughter] Very simple “yes or no” questions. That’s what I would do. Something as simple as… Bebé, you hungry? “Well… I haven’t eaten yet, so I probably should eat something, but I’m not feeling it right now. But if I don’t eat right now, you know how I’m gonna get later. So I guess it’s probably a good idea if I start eating right now, but it really depends on the options. What do you think?” Ah! What about this one? Bebé, where would you like to eat? [laughter] You hear all the guys? “Finally! I’m not alone!” Everybody’s pointing at somebody right now. Guys, am I right? This has to be– You would think that this is the safest question in the world to ask, but it’s not. “Well… Just pick something. You know me, I go with the flow. Whatever you decide is okay with me. You know me already, just pick something.” “Alright, we’re going to Burger King.” “I don’t like Burger King. Why do we got to go to Burger King? Burger King gives me chorro.” [laughter] Chorro is Mexican diarrhea. How about this one? “How do you feel?” “Really? Really? You want to know how I feel? Well, maybe if you’d pay attention from time to time, you might know how I feel. You might not need to have to ask me such a question, because you would already know exactly how I feel. You might have time and energy. I’m exhausted to let you know how I feel and you have the nerve to ask me ‘How do you feel?'”", "Now imagine the exact same conversation between me and Mr. Lexus. [laughter] Do you know how efficient that conversation would be? “Hey, bro! You hungry?” “I thought you’d never ask.” “What do you want to eat?” “Whatever you want to eat.” “We’re going to Burger King.” “I love Whoppers.” [laughter] “Me, too!” We go to Burger King and we tear it up. We get back home and I ask him, “Hey, how do you feel?” “Horny.” [laughter] “Me, too! How do you want to do this? Heads or tails?” [laughter] It would be efficient! [applause] This is hypothetical. But believe me, I still think about it, you know? Especially whenever I get into fights with my girl and she says something like, “Oh, you think you can do better?” I know I can have a Lexus. [laughter]", "I don’t know, man. I know we’re in the middle of a Netflix taping. Whoever is running the light up there, just want to make sure, ’cause I keep moving. And I stepped out of your light twice. Any other show, I’d be like, “No problem, no big deal.” But this is for Netflix. It’s the people that replaced Comedy Central. [crowd ooh’s] But no, I’ll try not to move too fast, but how slow are you if you can’t keep up with me? [laughter] You should work for Immigration. [laughter] I’m just giving you a hard time. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Ladies and gen– I apologize for that. Can we give a big round of applause to our person running the spotlight up there? [applause] I honestly don’t think that the people that work behind the scenes, like spotlight operators, get enough credit. Whether it’s spotlight operators, the people that run the cameras, the people that set up the stages, the people that work security, the people that run the building. Without them, there is no show. And the same thing goes with me. I got my own support team: managers, agents, promoters, you know, freaking merchandise people.", "I have a bus driver named ", ", who has never received any credit. And he’s been working for me for almost 10 years now. This man… [cheering and applause] This man has successfully gotten me to every single comedy show on time, without fail. [crowd cheering] If I had to describe him to you, okay? Dave looks like the word ‘Murica. [laughter] Not “America.” ‘Murica! He’s about six feet tall and he’s white. He has a gray beard and he wears a trucker hat. And he’s got to be one of the most hardworking people I have ever met. When I say hardworking, Hey, I’m on the road 46 weeks out of the year. So I know. The difference is I fly home every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Dave stays on that bus and he gets it to the next city, where we meet him. He works anniversaries, holidays, special moments. Christmas time, I was with my family. Dave was driving that bus on the East Coast. New Year’s, I was with my family. Dave was on the East Coast driving that bus. One of the hardest working people I’ve ever met. I just want to give a shout-out. [applause, cheering] In addition to being hardworking, he’s, uh– He’s very honest. When I say honest, I don’t mean “Oh, he does his taxes right.” I mean painfully honest. No-filter honest. He talks the way people used to. He does not have time to mince words. He just calls it like he sees it. Before me, he used to work with a man by the name of Kenny G. Grammy Award winner, amazing, amazing music. Um… one day, Kenny G was on his tour bus that Dave was driving, and I guess the two of them had a little discussion and Kenny G used some words that Dave would’ve rather him not have used. And instead of getting into it with him, this is what Dave does. [mimics engine, tires screeching] [brake hissing, door whooshing] Kicked Kenny G off of his own bus. [laughter] Because he would rather lose his job than lose his self-respect. And that’s the man I work with. [cheering, applause]", "He’s a bad dude. You guys are clapping, but you should’ve seen the interview. Oh, man, it was a good one. [laughs] He looks at me and he says, “Hey! Let’s get one thing straight. I don’t give a shit who you are. You treat me right, I’ll treat you right. You pay me on time, you’ll live. [laughter] Not to mention the fact that he keeps that tour bus squeaky clean. And he takes a lot of pride in that as well. One night, I was drinking on the bus, and I go to put my cup down. And I miss the table, and the cup hit the floor. I didn’t get up right away to get the cup, because I figured I’ll get up in a couple minutes and make myself another drink, I’ll pick up the cup then. Dave sees the cup on the floor, and then he looks at me and says, “Hey! I ain’t your mama. Pick that shit up!” [laughter] I get to the back of the bus and I’m like, “Wait a minute, I pay him.” “Hey, Dave…” “Shut up!” “Yeah, I’ll be in the back, in my room. Thank you. Drive safe.” And people tell me, “You work with a man who talks that way to you? Why?” Let me tell you why. Because he’s honest. With Dave, you know exactly what you get. Nowadays, it’s so hard for me to tell who’s being genuine and who has an agenda, and with him, you know exactly where you stand. If he likes you, he loves you. And if not, you’re on the curb with Kenny G. [laughter]", "That being said, I have a story to share. [scattered whooping] About a year and a half ago, maybe longer, we’re on the bus and we’re heading down the highway. [mimics bus thrumming] Just so you have kind of an understanding of the bus layout. Let’s say this is the front. Here’s Dave, the driver. Empty seat. And then a sliding door that goes in between him and the rest of the tour bus. My buddy Alfred and I are in the living room portion and we’re watching TV. We’re watching the news, and on the news, there’s this person who is running for some type of office. No particular office. [laughter] And I guess their big plan is to erect a structure… [laughter] …between two bodies of land. [laughter] Somewhere. And I guess they want one side of the structure to finance the entire project. Well, my buddy Alfred and I have a lot of family that works in construction and we know a bad job when we see one. So we started to voice our opinion out loud about how we felt about this person and what they wanted to do. We’re being very loud. So loud, Dave can hear us and then we hear Dave. [exaggerated laugh] “‘Murica.” [laughter] I yell out to Dave, I say, “Be quiet, Dave. This isn’t about you.” He taps a button on the dashboard that activates the sliding door. And when the door is about that far from closing, he yells out, “I’m building a wall.” [thud] [laughter] I couldn’t even get upset because I was too much in shock over the fact that that came out of someone four feet away from me. My buddy Alfred and I, we looked like chickens. We’re like… [clucking noises] My cell phone goes off. [mimics phone vibrating] I take out my phone and there’s a text message. From Dave. [laughter] And I said, “That’s right. He better say, ‘I’m sorry.’ He better say, ‘Just kidding.'” I open up the text message and it says, “And you’re paying for it.” [laughter, applause] And people tell me, “You still work with him after that?” Yes, I do. I trust that man with my life every single night. I know where his heart’s at. He can say whatever he wants. At the end of the day, he still has to drive around the king of the Mexicans. [laughter] [whooping, applause]", "The point to this story is just because you have a difference in opinion, it doesn’t mean that you can’t have respect for one another, you can’t have love for one another, that you can’t have incredible friendships with one another. It’s our differences that make us special. What a lot of us need to work on is our delivery. It’s all in the way you say things. That’s why text messages are always misinterpreted. ‘Cause you read the text according to how you feel. “What does he mean, ‘Hello’?” Yeah. Anyway, Dave has gotten us to 48 of the 50 states. He doesn’t travel with us outside of America. He prefers it that way. Last year, we got a chance to do a European tour of 15 countries. Estonia, Germany, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, UK… We’re just bouncing around all over the place. And then we wound up on the other side of the world.", "\nOut of all the countries I performed in, my favorite country outside of home is ", ". And I’ll tell you why. Australia, much like us in America, has its list of priorities. You know what’s not on their list? Political correctness. They do not care about your feelings. It’s like a country full of Daves. [laughter] Believe it or not, it’s very refreshing to be around such a large group of people who speak their minds so freely. And if you know that before you go there, you’re going to have an amazing time, but if you don’t know that and you show up, it is a culture shock and a half, because I showed up and I didn’t know. Everybody says you got to see the beaches and I went to the beach. I had people coming up to me. “Hey! Somebody help me get him back in the water.” [laughter] “Yeah, right there, big fella. Look at you, right there. Oh, wait, he’s moving. He’s moving, he’s moving. Oh, he’s crying! He’s crying! I bet it tastes like gravy.” [laughter] It’s not bullying if everyone does it.", "Yeah, that being said, I’m in Australia. Sydney, Australia, at the Opera House, for me, was one of the most iconic places I’ve ever got to perform in and it was bucket list, definitely. After the show, I want to go hang out with some Aussies see what that was like. I’m hanging out at a pub. First things first. Australian people do not drink Foster’s beer. That’s an American thing. They don’t drink that over there. I tried ordering one to fit in, didn’t go over well. Bartender looked at me, “You like the taste of piss, do ya?” [laughter] “Okay, don’t order that again.” So I’m hanging out with these two Aussies and we’re drinking a rum called Bundaberg. At first glance, it looks like a Coca-Cola bottle because there’s a polar bear on the front and then you drink it and you’re like, “That’s not Coke.” [laughter] As we’re talking, a third Australian joined the conversation, and he sounded a little bit different from the other two. He had more of a raspy voice. More like… [growls indistinctly] He sounded like a drunk pirate underwater. [laughter] These two guys didn’t like him, so they called him a name and they left, and now it’s just me and drunk pirate. We’re talking about life. Life in America, life in Australia, talking about our differences. He tells me that he’s a professional knife maker. He’s showing me how it’s done, he’s showing me pictures. We wind up polishing off three bottles of this rum. And drunk wasn’t even the right word to describe our level. My tour manager Ryan, he comes up to me and he says, “Gabe, time to go.” And I look at Ryan and I’m like, “But Ryan, I just made a friend and he makes knives and they’re pretty.” My tour manager always knows how to talk to me no matter what condition I’m in. If I’m drunk, he knows better than to talk to me like I’m an adult. He talks to me like I’m two. He looks at me and he says, “Hey, buddy. [laughter] You hungry? [laughter] Well, listen, if we don’t leave right now, they’re gonna close McDonald’s and you’re going to have to eat at the airport.” I gotta go. “Alright, mate, you gotta go, you gotta go. No worries.” And he goes to shake my hand. And when he shook my hand, he put his personal pocket knife that he made in my hand as a gift. “That’s for you, mate. Thanks for being nice.” “Thank you! Thank you! I’ll cut cheeseburgers with this.” [laughter]", "We leave, and we head to the restaurant. [mimics engine] The manager at the restaurant recognized me. He’s a big fan. And he said, “Hey, stay as long as you like.” Shouldn’t have said that. The plan was do the show, go have some drinks, get a bite to eat, go to the hotel, shower up and then go to the airport. We stayed so long at the restaurant, we had to go straight to the airport. So we get there, and you don’t sober up in like two hours, after three bottles of rum. I was not in airport condition. [laughter] And so my tour manager has one hand on each shoulder, right? Ryan’s trying to push me through the airport, and, you know, he’s about 190. I’m not. [laughter] And he’s pushing me with everything. [laughter] And he gets me all the way to airport security. And airport security in Australia, you don’t have to take off your shoes, and I didn’t worry about taking off a belt because I don’t wear a belt, ’cause I have a butt. So he lines me up with airport security and he tells me, “I got to let you go.” “Don’t let me go.” “I got to let you go.” “Don’t let me go!” And then he pushed me, and I’m going forward. And he yells out, “You’re a plane!” and the two-year-old came out. “I’m a plane!” [laughter, applause] And now this Fluffy 747 is headed right for the metal detector, and I can see the security officer on the other side. [laughter] And when I got really close, Ryan yells out, “Wings down! Wings down!” And I went through and I didn’t touch the edges, but when I went through… [beep] -[man in the crowd] The knife. -[crowd gasps] I sobered up for half a second because I realized, Oh, my God, I forgot to check the knife that the guy gave me and it’s on me and I’ve already cleared the freaking… You know… So I’m like… The security officer does this. “Eh, go ahead.” [laughter] Houston, sober me would have internally celebrated the fact that I am not going to prison for sneaking a knife past airport security and boarding a flight. Drunk me was offended. [laughter] Oh, you can ask my buddy, Ryan was right behind me. I looked at the security officer and I said, “Hey! Hey! How do you know? How do you know I’m not a terrorist?” And I can hear my friends in line. “Fuck!” [laughter] The security officer in uniform, wearing a badge, looks at me and says, “Hey, when have you ever seen a fat terrorist?” [laughter] “Eh, look at him. He’s crying. I bet it tastes like gravy.” [laughter]", "Yeah. -You guys, I gotta tell you– -[man] We love you, Fluffy! What happened, bro? [man] We love you! Do you have a Lexus? [laughter] ‘Cause I’m not passing that up again. [laughter] [laughing] Sorry. I just– But thank you. [laughing] Actually, I’ve had some pretty awesome times over the last 20 years. And whenever I talk to fans, they have certain questions about my past, whether it’s my family, my upbringing, where my mom came from, where my dad came from… Certain stories. I love the fact that I had someone ask me one time, “In your 20-plus years as a comedian, what has been your greatest moment?” My greatest moment wasn’t even something that happened at a show, but it was because of what I was able to do for someone very special to me. My mom, who is no longer with us, she meant everything to me. She was my biggest supporter, even though she would never laugh at my jokes. She would get mad at her friends that wouldn’t laugh. -“¿Pendejo, por que no te ríes?” -[laughter] How come you don’t laugh?", "I did something really awesome for my mom before she passed away. I took her to go see a man by the name of ", ". [crowd cheering] In concert. now if you’re not familiar with who Vicente Fernandez is, he is basically Mexican Elvis. But he’s still alive. [laughter] So a few years ago, Vicente Fernandez and myself were both performing at the same venue, a venue called the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. It is no longer there. A woman by the name of Emily was running the building. I was there the week before Vicente Fernandez, and after three sold-out shows she comes up to me and says, “Gabriel, thank you so much for this incredible business. We’re so happy with how the shows turned out. I have a question for you. Is your mom a fan of Vicente Fernandez?” I said, “Emily, my mom’s Mexican. [laughter] It’s the law.” [laughter] “I thought so. Listen, Vicente Fernandez is going to be performing here next week. And I wanted to do something very special for you to show my appreciation. Do you think you and your mom would like to come see him perform and I’ll get you front-row center?” I said, “Emily, that sounds amazing. I’m pretty sure the answer is yes, but my mom is old school, so I still got to ask. I’ll call you.” So I get to my mom’s house, and I see her. “Mama.” “Dime, mi hijo.” Mi hijo in Spanish means “my son.” So my mom would always tell me that, my son, mi hijo. Mi hijo. “Dime, mi hijo.” “Tell me, my son.” I said, “Mom, would you like to go see Vicente Fernandez in concert?” And she looked at me and said, “Mi hijo, that sounds nice.” That’s exactly how she said it. She was very even-keeled. She wouldn’t show a lot of emotion. So I call Emily and I said my mom’s in. “Awesome. I’ll see you next week.” So we get to the venue and we’re early, so they have us in this little VIP section where they’re giving us free drinks and free snacks, and my mom was so cute. She walks up to me and she says, “Mi hijo, are the drinks free?” I said, “Mom, yeah, the drinks are free, but don’t worry about it.” “No, no, no, mi hijo, I didn’t bring any money. I don’t have no money.” I said, “Mom, you made an ATM. You’re good.” [laughter] [cheering, applause] The messed up part is that she didn’t even like drinking. She just wanted to walk around with a couple of drinks so she’d look like she was part of the party. -[laughter] -You know? So she’s got a couple drinks, and as it was, when she’d walk around, she’d have a little bit of a limp, because she had just had toe surgery a couple months prior. So she had kind of like a little– It looked like she was dancing. [vocalizing] So she’s walking around. Here comes Emily. “Gabriel, you made it!” I go, “Yeah, this is my mom. Emily, this is my mom, Esther. Mom, this is Emily.” “They’re free!” “She knows they’re free. She made this happen.” “Oh, thank you, thank you! You’re the one who hired mi hijo. Gracias. Thank you so much.” Emily goes, “Can I talk to you for a second?” “Sure. Mom, I’ll be right back. What’s up, Emily?” “Gabriel, do you think your mom would you like to meet Vicente Fernandez right now?” I said, “Emily, let me tell you something… [laughter] …if she says no, I want to meet him. [laughter] I’ll be right back.” “Mamá.” “Dime, mi hijo”. Emily wants to know if you would like to meet Vicente Fernandez right now. “Mi hijo, that sounds nice.” “Alright. Emily, she’s in.” Emily goes, “Is she even a fan?” I go, “Trust me, that’s her reaction. She’s good. She has the whole house covered with Vicente Fernandez records and cassettes. Okay? We’re good.” So Emily comes back. And she puts the special VIP bracelets on us with a little click, and she walks us through a door into the backstage area. As soon as we went through the door, I knew exactly where we were. I was just there a week ago. So I got my mom arm in arm, and we’re walking down the hallway, okay? Come on, Mama. Let’s go. Let’s go. We’re walking down the hallway, and we’re getting closer and closer to Vicente Fernandez’s dressing room. The door is wide open, and I can hear a commotion coming out of the dressing room. [shrieking] And then a man and a woman exit the room and the man is holding on to the woman’s shoulders and he’s like, “It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s okay, it’s okay.” And the woman looks destroyed. Okay? [wailing] Mascara is running down her face. My mom sees that and she’s like, “Mi hijo, did you see that? Did you see the mascara… [shrieks] With the mascara– Parece puta la cabrona.” [laughter] Sorry. Puta means “friendly.” [laughter] So we get by the door, and the closer we get, we start to see a guy in the room. Then he comes to the door. In the room, there’s three people, okay? There’s Vicente Fernandez, the photographer and a handler. The handler comes to the door, and you can tell by his voice that he works for like a Mexican radio station, ’cause he’s got that voice. “Hola! Hola! Pasale! Pasale!” Pasale in Spanish means “come on in.” So we start to walk into the room. And let me tell you guys something, If you grew up listening to Vicente Fernandez from a young age, and you get the opportunity to meet him, it is seriously a religious experience. My mom and I are entering the room, the only thing missing is the freaking… [imitates cleric speaking Latin] [laughter] You don’t look at him. You look at the floor. Out of respect, you just look at the floor. “Come on, Ma”. We get all the way up to him and I see boots. And when I see the boots, my mom and I both just… [laughter] He knows what you’re doing. He knows you’re checking him out. So what he does is he poses, okay? Vicente stands there and he poses. He’ll have the sombrero, the hat, to his side. And then, he doesn’t look at you. He looks away. [laughter] And he sticks his chest out and he stands there looking like a big-ass bottle of Tapatio at Costco. [laughter] [applause] And then he looked at me. [mimics whooshing] And he recognized me. not as a comedian, but because I was there the week before and my photo was hanging outside his door. It was whoever is there last, they always rotate the photo. So he sees me and he’s like, “Mi hijo, tu eres el muchacho que esta en la foto ahí afuera.” “Yeah, that’s me outside, yeah. Hola!” [laughter] “Oh. Vicente, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Le presento… mi mamá!” [laughter] I’m like, “Oh, my God. I think I just offered up my mom to Vicente Fernandez.” [laughter] She’s like 73. “Better late than never, Mom, get him!” My mom starts walking up to, Vicente. He was so nice. He goes out to shake my mom’s hand and my mom grabs his hand. And I don’t know where she got this strength and energy from, but she grabbed him and pulled him in. Hard, like the video game. “Get over here!” And then hooked him. She hooked him and she starts screaming into his chest. “Mi Chente!” I’m like, “Oh, my God. She’s getting horny.” [laughter] And he knew, too! ‘Cause he was like, “Quitamela! Quitamela!” The photographer, the handler and me. The three of us is what it took to pull her off of Vicente. We sit her down, she’s bawling. [wailing] Mascara is running down her face. [laughter] The photographer shaking his head. I guess Vicente had dinner earlier that night. He was eating barbecue, ’cause they had those wet naps. Barbecue wet naps. And so we take the wet naps and we start cleaning the mascara off my mom’s face. We stand her up. We posed her and we took the picture. Emily comes over and she takes us and she escorts us to our seats in the front. And for three hours… for three hours, my mom was on her feet listening to him and she refused to sit down. “Mom, you should sit down–” “No, ¿cómo qué? És el Chente.” Holding a shot of tequila that she never drank. [laughter] She just– She was– [laughter] Three hours on her feet. Never once sat down. That’s how powerful his music was. [applause] My mom felt no pain for that entire time. And the minute that freaking concert was over, “Tan-taran, tan-tan.” “My feet! Oh, my God, mi hijo, mis pies. Ay, pinche callo. “Oh, my God, my feet! Ay!” And I’m like, “Oh, great.” So now I gotta drag this living novela to the parking lot. I helped her into the car. “My feet!” “I told you to sit down.” “You don’t sit for Chente.” Here comes Emily. “Did you guys have a good time?” I go, “Emily, we had the greatest time. Thank you so much.” “I got something for you.” Oh, what’s that? And she hands me an envelope and I open it, and inside the envelope is the picture. She printed it out for me, and when I looked at it I got so choked up because I have never seen my mom so happy in a picture. And it’s not that she wouldn’t smile. She would smile, but it was that “one, two, three, cheese.” [laughter] But this one was like… [laughter] And what makes it extra special is that it’s the last photo I have of my mom and she was the happiest. And I know that that moment wouldn’t be possible if I did not do this for a living. [applause] So thank you for that. Sorry, now a lot of people are like, “We came to laugh…” -[mumbling indistinctly in Spanish] -[laughter]", "Houston, I got to share this story. Twenty years ago, when I started doing this, okay, the fact that we’re here tonight in an arena doing a comedy special is huge, but everything… Everything has a beginning. The fact that I can travel and I meet so many people, “we are your fans,” “we are your fans,” and social media shows over 10 million, everything comes from somewhere. And the fact that tonight I have in the audience my first two fans that ever came out to see one of my shows, I flew them out from Los Angeles to be here tonight. [cheering and applause] Monica, Tony, where you guys at? There you are. Ladies and gentlemen… [crowd cheering] …Monica and Tony Sanchez. When I say they were my first fans, they were my first, they would come out… I used to perform in her garage. And she’ll tell you. Oh, yeah. Right next to the Ford. [laughter] They were the first ones. They were the first ones to come see me perform at a little dive– hole-in-the-wall inside of a casino in California. And, um… You know, to have met these people so many years ago and they’d come out, she would tell me with her husband, “You were so funny, we’ll be back next week.” I’m like, “But it’s the same 5-minute show.” She goes, “You’re funny, we’ll bring more people. We’ll bring more people. She was my first fan club. She would get friends and bring them out to the show. [applause] And she has pictures of me in that garage. I wish you wouldn’t put them online, but you do. [laughter] But I just wanted to say thank you, guys, and I’m glad you could be here tonight. Twenty years doing this, so I think it’s only right that tonight we close this show the way that the first one began. [cheering, applause] I get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-thru. You better still laugh, Houston! I made a left turn instead of making a right turn but I wasn’t paying attention ’cause I had a box, right? I was like, “You’re going to get it when you get home, you’ve been so bad! So bad! [screams] Gonna get it!” I’m not paying attention, I go the wrong way. [mimics car turning] Sure enough… [mimics siren chirping] Oh! [tires screech] Later. [mumbling] The officer is taking forever. I said, “Forget this, he’s taking too long.” I grab my box, I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. Hmm! [laughs] Hmm… [shrieks] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window. “You know why I stopped you?” It was too easy. -I said, “‘Cause you could smell it!” -[crowd] …could smell it! [cheering and applause] Keep going! [crowd exclaims] -Houston, keep going! -[crowd] Yeah! I should have started the show like this, okay? Um, I bought a Volkswagen Beetle about seven years ago. [crowd cheering] And when you buy a new car, you want to show it off, whether it’s brand new or just new to you. So I take my car to my friend Martin’s house. You’ve seen Martin. Very real. I pull up. [mimics tires screeching] I yell out the window, -Mar– -[crowd, in unison] Martin! [cheering, applause] [whooping] You don’t need me anymore. [laughter] That’s freaking awesome! Thank you. Love you, too. Hold on, hold on. I forgot the joke. Hold on. [laughter] I know how it starts and I know how it ends. I’m just not used to starting from the middle. [laughter] That’s what she said. No, just– [laughter] Stop. You deserve better than that. Um… Martin… lives in a bad neighborhood. I don’t get out of the car. Across the street from his house live these gang members, the kind of gang members who don’t really hurt anybody. They just talk a lot of trash and watch Frozen. [laughter] And I pull up in a Beetle. [mimics tires screeching] [all in unison] Martin! Across the street, I hear… [all in unison] Órale! [cheering and applause] Let me finish! [laughter] -Someone said, “That’s what she said.” -[laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Hey, hey. [clicks tongue] Ah! I turn around. “Hey, what’s up, you guys? How’s it going?” “How did you get in there, ese?” “Hurry up, Martin!” A couple of months go by. I fix up the car. I put racing rims on it, some stickers. I put little chip in the motor to make it go faster. Two hundred and fifty horsepower Volkswagen Beetle. The car is bad. I pull up. [mimics driving, tires screeching] [engine revving] -[horn honking] -[laughter] [all in unison] Martin! [all in unison] Órale! Some of you are drunk. [laughter] This is what I just heard. I heard… “Órale!” “Le!” Keep up! I know it’s Mexicans too. I hear the accent. I hear that– [mumbles indistinctly mocking Mexican accent] Even the white people are like, “Hello! It’s odalay.” [laughter] “Get it together.” Keep up! -Eh. -[crowd] Eh. [all in unison] Eh. [all in unison] Yoo-hoo! “What?” [all in unison] “Check it out, eh, it’s the Fat and the Furious!” I heard you, Houston! [cheering and applause] I heard you. You guys were saying the joke with me like it was a song. Like it was the Mexican version of Freebird. [laughter] Keep going! [crowd roars] Keep going! [crowd roars] Chills.", "My son Frankie, when he graduated from high school, I was very, very proud of him and I was very excited. And, uh… For me, it was very emotional, because I was the one that got to take him to school on that last day, and it meant a lot, because you know what? [laughs] I was allowed to leave him anywhere I wanted to. I can leave him in the front. I can leave him on the side. I can put him in the back. I can make him walk. That wasn’t the case many years ago, when I was taking him to elementary school. And they had a designated drop-off area on the side of the school, where they had cones in the middle of the street. They had a supervisor there with a walkie-talkie and a whistle to make sure that your kids would get out of the car safely and onto the school grounds. One day we’re late because the night before I had a big show like this one. And people brought me chocolate cakes. And I took the cakes home and my son killed one of the cakes. And the next day, the cake… [mimics stomach rumbling] …killed Frankie. [laughter] Oh, it was bad. [mimics high-pitched fart] Chorro! Chocomilk! For the non-Mexicans: Yoo-hoo! [laughter] For the non-Mexicans with money: Nestle Quik! [laughter] Same joke. We get to the school. There’s no longer supervisor, no walkie-talkie, no whistle, the gate’s locked. I said, “I’m not leaving my kid here.” I’m going to drop him off in front. And I guess I wasn’t supposed to do that and I didn’t know, and at the time, I didn’t really care. We pull up. [mimics car driving, tires screeching] “Go.” “I’m not supposed to get off here.” “You’re late. Go.” [groans] And he cracks the door. And as soon as his foot hits the curb, here comes the principal. And I know who it is, ’cause he’s freaking out, right? He’s like… [whispering] “It’s the principal!” “Dude, relax. I’m 32, I don’t give a damn!” [laughter] Here comes the principal and she’s doing this one. [high-pitched voice] “Sir! Sir! Sir, this is not the designated drop-off area. Please take your child to the other side of the school. You cannot leave him here.” I was like, “Watch this.” Señora, no sé lo que esta diciendo. Aqui estoy dejando a mi hijo. El no se levantó a la mañana. It’s not my fault. Yo no sé. “That’s how you do it, homeboy. That’s how you do it.” That principal was awesome because she was like, [American accent] Usted no puede dejar su hijo aqui. Okay? [American accent] Saca la vuelta al otro lado de la escuela. Okay? [all in unison] Allá, si, si. Aqui, no, no. [all in unison] Allá, si, si. Aqui, no, no. [all in unison] Yo no soy pendeja! [laughter, applause] Monica, Tony. Twenty years ago, when I was in your garage, if you would’ve told me this was going to happen I’d have said you’re crazy. If you would have told me, “Twenty years from now people are going to come out and fill up arenas to see you. They’re going to cheer for you, and they’re going to finish your jokes… in Houston, Texas.” [crowd cheering, applauding] This special is dedicated to both of you and to this city. That’s Houston strong. Thank you very much, and you have a great night! And I hope I keep making you proud. Thank you.

[Fluffy shouts] Houston! [crowd cheering] [audience] Five, four, three, two, one! [cheering]", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho man ♪", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho! ♪", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho man ♪", "\n♪ Macho, macho man ♪", "\n♪ I’ve got to be a macho! ♪", "How are you?", "[crowd roars]", "[Fluffy] Whoo! Oh, man! That’s a long walk. [laughter] Thank you so much, Houston. [crowd cheering] One year ago, this city was flipped upside down by a hurricane, un cabrón named Harvey. [laughter] And they said that this city would never be the same. I think it’s beautiful that, a year later, we’re all here celebrating together the fact that this city is resilient. And you guys persevered. Houston’s strong, baby. [crowd cheering, applauding] That’s serious. In all sincerity, guys, I’m not trying to kiss your ass. I already got your money. [laughter] Freaking Houston. I love this town. I’ve been coming here for 20 years. Twenty years. Started off performing at a comedy club called The Last Stop. [cheering] And then, of course, we jumped over to the Improv, and then– I performed everywhere. I even did a one-nighter in Tomball. [laughter] That’s a long story for the people at home. I won’t even get into that. I want to give you guys a heads-up and let you know now that tonight I feel extra comfortable. You’re going to notice that you might hear a little bit more Spanish than you normally would. And you can’t do that just anywhere, but you can do that in Houston. [cheering and applause] Now, to everyone watching at home who is freaking out, like, “Oh, my God! I didn’t sign up for this.” [laughter] If I say something in Spanish, my promise is to translate immediately so that everyone enjoys the show. Okay? ‘Cause I know the second I said Spanish, people are freaking out, you know. All the people that drove in from the woodlands are like, “Hey!” [laughter] And for everyone at home, what does he mean by that, the people from the woodlands? You know. [laughter] [South Texas accent] “I know he is not referring to us.” [laughter] “The nerve of him!” “He needs to go back where he came from, over by Airline Road.” [laughter] [cheering] That’s right. I know where you keep your brown people. [laughter] This is awesome. This always pisses off Netflix. They’re like, “Gabriel, we really wish you would just do a show that’s general, that everybody understands. Why do you have to make your show so personal? Only people in that city are going to get it.” Well, when you have an arena full of people, you want them to get it. You want that extra personal special touch. I don’t care what they say. I already got the check. [laughter] Ha!", "So let me give you a heads-up as to what has happened since the last time I did a special. Um, my son, ", ", is now 19 years old. Nineteen years old, high school graduate, he has all his shots… Ladies? People tell me all the time. “Why do you talk about your son so much?” Because he won’t leave. [laughter] “Does he like it when you talk about him?” I said, “No, he hates it.” “Why do you do it?” “‘Cause he won’t leave.” [laughter] I’ll tell you what he likes to do right now. He likes to sit around the house and watch videos of other kids playing video games. See, some of you are clapping. I didn’t know that was an actual thing. I asked him, “What are you doing?” “I’m watching other kids playing video games.” I said, “That’s– Really? Why?” “Well, they’re professionals.” I’m like, “Why would you watch something that you could be doing?” “‘Cause they’re professionals.” “That’s dumb.” “Really, Dad? Every Sunday I see you watching football. [crowd ooh’s] How come you don’t play?” I don’t even argue. I just cut off the Internet. [laughter] My son’s problem right now is that he has, according to him, too many options. Okay? That’s his problem. I’m like, “Poor guy!” “I have so many options, Dad. I don’t know what to do.” Write them down. Put them on a wheel. Freaking– [mimics spinning wheel] Today: plumber. [laughter] Something! The problem is we go places, people find out he is my son and then they offer him opportunities. He doesn’t understand that that’s not how the real world works. I know about struggling and clawing, and fighting for the opportunity to do something. He doesn’t get it yet. And that’s my fault.", "For example, I take him and his mom out to dinner, okay? I took them both to ", ". Now, Houston. Me, personally, I love Red Lobster, okay? And not even for the seafood. I’m talking about the biscuits. [cheering] Oh, yeah. [vocalizes] It’s real good. [laughter] So we’re sitting there, and we’re having a conversation with our son about life, opportunity, what does he want to do with himself… And as we’re talking to him, the manager from Red Lobster walks over to our table. And he’s being really cool, right? He’s like, “Hey!” And I’m like, “Hey!” He looks at my son, “Is this the infamous Frankie?” And I say, “Why, yes, it is! He just graduated.” “Congratulations!” “And he’s looking for a job.” The manager goes, “Oh, say no more.” And he gives my son a business card and then he starts to say, “Listen, Frankie, this is all you have to do. Just go online and fill out the application. Once it’s registered, call me personally and I’ll see to it that you get an interview. The only position we have available right now is for a host, but there’s plenty of room for opportunity here at Red Lobster. Besides, you got one hell of a reference.” And then he walked away and I was like, “Oh, my God. I’m going to get free biscuits!” [laughter] My son looks at me and says, “I don’t want to work at Red Lobster.” I said, “Frankie, no one is making you work anywhere. This is just another opportunity that you’re wasting. Okay. No Red Lobster. What’s your plan?” “I don’t know.” I got frustrated. So I raised my voice. “Well, you better start thinking.” His mom didn’t like that. “Don’t talk to him like that.” I said, “Look, biscuit blocker…” [laughter] See, up to this point we have agreed on how we raise our son. But in this situation, she’s trying to protect him from the world. I’m trying to prepare him for the world. If he cannot handle me raising my voice to get his attention to see the bigger picture, he’s not ready for a world that doesn’t care about his feelings. [crowd whooping, applauding]", "So I said, “You know what? I got to have a one-on-one with him. I got to have a one-on-one with, uh–” [evil laugh] So I take him out to the movies. I take him out to the movies, we get in the car, we take off. [mimics car engine] A little 20-minute drive, okay? As we’re driving I figure I’ll have a little one-on-one with him. Maybe this way it doesn’t feel like a talk talk. I thought he understood what I was trying to say. It’s late. We’re leaving the movies. We’re pulling out of the parking structure and out of the corner of my eye, I see a cop car. And I made a sound, I was like, “Ugh!” And Frankie goes, “What is it, Dad?” I say, “There’s a cop at the light.” “What are you worried about?” “He’s going to stop us.” “How do you know?” “Watch.” [laughter] I made that left turn… [mimics engine and siren chirping] Frankie’s losing it. “It’s happening!” I said, “Relax.” I pull over. [mimics tires screeching] Cop pulls up from behind. [mimics tires screeching] Immediately. [knock-knock] “Driver, windows down.” [groans] [mimics window whirring down] “Driver, hands out the window.” Serious? [laughter] “Both of them.” “I can’t, I’m fat!” [laughter] He gets to the window, and he’s got the flashlight. And he shines the light right in my face. He’s like, “License.” “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.” He takes the license and then, of course, you know, “Do you know why I stopped you?” “Officer, no, I don’t, but I’m sure you’re about to tell me.” “You don’t have a front plate on your car.” I said, “Officer, you’re absolutely right. I do not have a front plate on my car, but my name is actually on the front of the car.” “Excuse me?” “My name is on the front of the car.” I own a 2012 Ford Flex and the Ford Flex has the actual word “flex” written on the hood. I have a friend who does custom automotive work and he took all the letters off the car except for the letter F, and he made letters so that it spells “Fluffy” on the hood. Okay? Yeah. -It sounds impressive. -[crowd whooping] You can do it too for like $23. It’s not that bad. They’re like refrigerator magnets. You can even move them. Like, one day a letter flew off and it said “Fuffy”. [laughter] Que pendejo. I know, stupid, right? So… The officer walks around to the front of the car and he takes his flashlight and he shines the light right on the hood, and he does this, he goes, “I knew it!” And my son goes, “What does that mean?” I said, “That means we get to go.” Oh, Houston, for the first time in a long time, my son was actually impressed by something that I did. You got to figure. This is not impressive to my son. Because he grew up in this environment.", "Okay, this does– You saw that, right? I saw like a– [laughter] That’s like the third one I’ve seen! This stuff keeps– [chuckles] People upstairs from Tomball, “Keep talking.” [laughter] Alright, I’ll tell you guys what happened. Shakira performed here a few days ago. And Shakira has an amazing show, okay? She doesn’t just come out and… [ululates] [humming “Whenever, Wherever” by Shakira] ♪ Together, together ♪ [indistinct] [crowd cheering] I think I just hurt myself. [laughter] But there’s a part of her show, where all of a sudden it was… [puffing] And there’s cannons with confetti that shoot everywhere, right? And I think that was left-over Shakira. [laughter] Can we edit out the part where I burned 800 calories? [laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Oh, my God! So, where was I? Oh! This. Does nothing for my son. and the reason why I say that is because he grew up in this environment. He’s been to a thousand shows. He’s seen me on TV a million times. It’s not a big deal, but the fact that I got stopped by a cop and the cop recognized me and geeked out and let us go, I earned street cred with my kid! [laughter] Yeah, Frankie was like, “That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen!” And I’m like, “Hell, yeah, cos’. That’s right. You better recognize, player.” [laughter] [mimics engine turning over] We get home, he woke up his mom! “Mom, you should’ve seen it! We got stopped by the cops!” “Are you okay?” “Yeah! They recognized Dad and they let us go.” She stayed quiet and I told her, “Huh? I got recognized!” And she said, “Ah!” [laughter]", "So my son, what he likes to do now, like I said, Frankie likes to stay home and watch videos. I come downstairs one morning and he’s on his phone, but the chair that he’s sitting in is turned, facing the window, which I thought was weird. So I called to him, “Frankie, what are you doing?” Nothing. So he can’t hear– “Frankie!” He can’t hear. So I walked up from behind, and I realized that my son has little headphones. That’s– Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, he’s not ignoring me. So I look over his shoulder, and I realize that my son is watching a film. [crowd ooh’s] And I don’t mean Frozen. [laughter] But those people look cold. [laughter] So now I’m standing there watching it with him. I’m not trying to bond or anything. I’m just trying to figure out the conversation I need to have and now we’re both watching professionals. [laughter] So I grabbed his headphone and I went… “Hey, is that a good movie?” And he freaked out! [screams] And he threw the phone. The phone came partially undone and you could hear it. Oh, it was bad. “Not my face, not my face, not my face.” He turned bright red and he starts walking back over. “How embarrassing. How long have you been standing there?” I said, “Long enough to know ‘not my face.'” [laughter] “Are you going to tell my mom?” I said, “Frankie, I love you way too much to do that to you. I would never tell your mom. I’mma tell everybody else.” [laughter] [laughs] Hey, don’t tell his mom. [laughter] I said, “Look, I know you’re not going to stop watching stuff like this. So just do me a favor. Don’t do this here. You’re old enough now to watch whatever you want to watch. But as long as you live in this house, you cannot be watching stuff like that where your mom can catch you. You’re not going to stop, so just don’t do it here.” “How do you know I’m not gonna stop?” “‘Cause I haven’t stopped. [laughter] Matter of fact, there’s a sequel to that. [laughter] It’s called Not my hair.” He said to me, “Que cochino!” I know right? [panting] I said, “Frankie, you’re going to watch stuff like that, just go in your room. Lock your door. I don’t want to catch you. Okay, so let me know.” “Want me to text you?” Never mind. [laughter]", "I’m in the middle of trying to deal with this whole situation with my son watching these videos and not going to work, and while I’m doing this, I get the most random phone call I’ve ever gotten. My publicist calls me up and she’s like, “Gabe! ", " is looking for you.” -“Excuse me?” -“Snoop Dogg, you know–” “I know who Snoop Dogg is! What do you mean, he’s looking for me?” “Well, he’s looking–” “Is he looking for me or is he looking for me?” “He’s a fan and he wants to interview you.” “Oh, cool! Sounds good. What is it?” “I think it’s some type of podcast.” “I’m in. Can I bring Frankie?” “Absolutely.” “Cool.” So I hang up the phone. I’m excited. I want to tell my son. I’m like, “Frankie! I’m walking towards your room.” [laughter] I’ll be at your door in three, two, one. Hey! Alright, you’re dressed. Good. Come on, let’s go. “Where are we going?” “Watch.” We get in the car. [mimics engine] And now we’re off on this adventure to go do an interview with Snoop Dogg. You guys, let me tell you something. We get to the neighborhood and we’re lost. The GPS says we’re there, but we’re lost. We’re looking for a house, and there’s no house, just a big building. And so I’m like, “This doesn’t look– A podcast? Really?” So I pull up to the security gate. [mimics engine, tires screeching] Tap the button on the wall. [beep, line trilling] “Security desk. Can I help you?” Hey, Security Desk. My name is Gabriel Iglesias. I think I’m here to do an interview with Snoop Dogg. “Okay, one moment.” Oh, okay, this is it. Good, good. I’m so excited. Snoop Dogg! It’s gonna be cool, right? [laughter] “Sir?” “Yes?” “Yes, hi, there’s no Gilbert Ignazios on file.” What? “Could it be another name?” “Another name? I don’t know. Fluffy, maybe?” [beep] And the gate starts to open. [laughter] I’m like, “Oh, my God, I’m officially in the rappers’ world because my real name doesn’t mean shit!” [laughter] So we drive in. [mimics engine] And we’re passing all of these reserved parking spaces. Reserved, reserved, reserved, reserved. And we get to my space, which is basically an orange cone that has “Fluffy” handwritten on it. And a bunch of other names crossed off. [laughs] So Frankie moves the cone. I park the car. [vocalizes] We walk into the building. My publicist is waiting for me, right? She’s like, “Gabe! You made it. Frankie, how are you? Listen. I just finished talking to Snoop. [sighs]", "Wow. He is everything you think he is and just a little bit more. He is so sweet. I cannot believe he was charged with double murder.” [laughter] “He told me to just walk you guys into the studio and he’ll be right back. He said he had to go outside and get in the right headspace or something…” “Okay, cool.” So she walks us into Snoop’s studio. I’m thinking I’m there for a podcast, come to find out it’s for a TV show. Snoop has a TV show where he interviews celebrities. Everyone in the room is waiting for Snoop to return. You can hear the small talk. [indistinct babbling, giggling] [crowd laughs] All of a sudden, everyone stands up and I’m looking around like, “What’s going on?” And I look at the door to see if Snoop’s walking in and I don’t see him and I could see my son. “Dad!” [muffled screaming] I don’t realize it, but Snoop is entering the room through a different door. I don’t realize it till, like, the last second. I’m like, “What do you–” So I jump up, I push in my chair. I’m so nervous, I don’t know how to address him. So I’m like… [laughter] I felt stupid. “Hi.” [laughter] Snoop walks over to me and he’s so cool, you guys. He’s so cool. He walks over to me and he grabs my hand. He’s really strong. He pulls me in and he says, “Yo, what it do, baby boo, how you feel?” [laughter, applause] “Thank you for having me.” “Yeah.” -“Can I sit down?” -“For sure.” [mimics chair] I sit down, I look over, I see my son. My son’s like… [laughter] The difference between Snoop’s show versus any other talk show I’ve ever done is that usually there’s a person, like a producer or a director who comes to you and gives you information, like how the show begins, topics you’re going to cover, how you go to commercial, how you come back from commercial… I’ve spoken to no one. Snoop just starts talking and at some point, they hit “Record.” I’m waiting for “Action!” or a buzzer. [mimics buzzer] Something! Snoop just starts talking to me. “Yo, what up, big Fluff?” “Big Fluff? Oh, that’s– Hey!” [laughter] “Yo, you like music?” “Snoop, I love music. I love your music.” “Yeah, that’s what’s up.” He opens up a laptop computer and then he hits “play.” And the next thing I know, we are listening to hardcore Mexican banda music. I mean hardcore. [vocalizing] And you can hear gunshots in the song. [laughter] [humming, mimics gunshots] [humming, mimics gunshots] [humming] And then a cow. [moos] [laughter] And the whole time Snoop is like, “I love it when he go moo.” [laughter] What? I feel like he’s messing with me because I’m Mexican, right? So I called him out. I said, “Snoop. Do you understand what you’re listening to?” And he said this, and it’s scared me. He said, “Gangster recognize gangster.” [crowd ooh’s] The reason why it scared me was because he was telling the truth. We were listening to actual Mexican cartel songs that don’t play on the radio. And the fact that he knew that, the fact that his level of street knowledge in another language was that on point, I said, “I gotta shut the hell up.” [laughter] Don’t speak unless spoken to. That’s the code. Next thing I know, Snoop reaches under the desk and he pulls out the biggest blunt I have ever seen. [crowd gasps] Oh, this sucker was huge. As soon as he pulled out that freaking blunt, got excited because I wanted to grab my cell phone. Okay, I wanted to grab my cell phone so that I could take a selfie of Snoop in the background being Snoop. So while I’m fumbling trying to get my phone, Snoop starts talking to me again. “Yo, Big Fluff?” Yeah, what? “Hit that while I hit this.” [laughter] The second I went like that, all of the cameras in the room: red light. Red light. Red light. Red light. Red light. My publicist is like, “No!” My son is like, “Yeah!” And now I’m being faced, bro. I’m being faced with a serious situation, because, you know, I’ve talked about friends participating and doing stuff like this, but I’ve never openly talked about myself… You know… And now I realized that from this moment forward, people are going to know what happened here with Snoop. So I started trying to find ways to justify it to myself. You know… If you’re going to do something like this on camera, you want it to be with Snoop. [laughter] You want it to be with Snoop, Cheech and Chong… [crowd cheering] …or Willie Nelson. [crowd cheering] Next thing I know, the manager hands me a lighter. I light it and I take a big hit. [sucking] So listen, I’m doing my best to hold in all this smoke, because I don’t want to look like a punk in front of Snoop Dogg. I’m trying, I’m fighting, bro. It’s hard, you know. [holding cough in] [laughter] The whole time Snoop is like, “Hell, yeah. That’s what I’m saying. Fluffy going puffy today.” [laughter] I do not remember the rest of the interview. What I remember is my buddy Anthony telling Snoop Dogg and I to stand up for a picture. “Stand up, get up for a picture.” And so Snoop and I both stand up to take this picture. I put my arm around him. I have to put my arm around him because he’s much taller than me, okay? Snoop has me by at least five inches. Shut up, alright? [laughs] [crowd cheering] You guys are laughing at the wrong jokes! [laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Bow-wow! [laughter] [low-pitched] Bow-wow. Everybody’s like, “This is a family show!” Well, apparently, that’s how families are made. That was too funny, sir. That was too funny. It’s sad how hard she laughed at that as she looked right at you. [laughter] I said, “Snoop has me by at least five inches,” and she’s like… [shrieks] Almost like she wasn’t even laughing at me. She was like laughing at you. So apparently you guys have some story that I just reignited. And now it’s awkward for all the kids. [laughter]", "So anyway… Snoop and I are taking photos, and then I can hear my son. “Dad! Dad!” [gasps] “Oh! Um, Snoop, can my son take a photo with you?” “Yeah.” “Get over here!” And so Frankie runs up, you guys, and he’s so cute, because he’s geeking out really hard. He’s like… [laughter] “Snoop, this is my son, Frankie. Frankie, say hello to Snoop.” And Snoop looks at me, and he’s so cool, Snoop is like… “Yo, this your kid? What up, Baby Fluff?” [laughter] And Frankie’s like… [laughter] “I don’t like that name.” “That’s too bad. Get a job, go. Go.” So Snoop and Frankie go into the corner to take pictures. Meanwhile, I walk back over to the desk, because I want to grab the sheet that has Snoop’s name and my name on it. I want to have Snoop autograph it so that I can frame it and put it on my wall. While I’m doing that, Frankie walks up from behind me and he whispers in my ear, trying to be all cool. “Dad! Dad!” “Huh? What? What?” “Dad, would it be okay if I finish smoking that with Snoop?” [laughter] Now I am being faced with the biggest moral decision of my life. And I’m high. And my mind is racing a thousand miles an hour. I’m like, “Should I let him, should I not? Am I a good dad, am I a bad dad? What’s his mom gonna think? I need a Snickers.” I’m just– And then I thought about it. “You know… Frankie, you’re over 18. Technically, you don’t have to ask me if you don’t want to, so as far as I’m–” [laughter] “Where’d you go?” A minute later, I am recording my son in a cloud with Snoop Dogg. [crowd cheering] And then I sent the video to his mom. [laughter] Hashtag biscuit blocker. Yes, I did. [laughter] Now, did this actually happen? Yes, it did. You can go online and watch the video on YouTube. Punch in “Snoop Dogg”, next to that put “Fluffy” or “Gabriel” and you can see the whole thing. Let me know how it turns out. [laughter] The fact that I got to meet Snoop was awesome. He looked for me. But every now and then, I go out and I want to meet people, I want to see cool things. For example, comedy. I’m a huge fan of comedy. Not just performing it. But I love going to shows. I go to a comedy show every now and then, alone. Now, I don’t know if that sounds weird to you guys, but for me to do anything nowadays by myself… It’s my crew. All the people that work for me, they freak out when I go places. They’re always concerned for my safety. “What if someone tries to kidnap you?” [laughter] Well, they’re going to earn it. [laughter] I got into a fight with some of my team members and I said, “You know what? I’m going out.”", "I bought myself a ticket and I went to go watch ", ", one night, in concert. [crowd cheering] Now, I says, “You know what? Maybe I can make my way backstage and, I don’t know, if I get lucky, maybe I’ll say hi to him. I’ve always wanted to meet him.” So I go to the side of the stage and I run into security. And I said, “Hey!” He looked at me and said, “Fluffy!” When he did that, I said, “Hey, listen, I forgot my keys, I’ll be right back.” And the guy’s like, “Yeah, keep going, get your keys.” I’m like, “Oh, my God, that shit worked!” [laughter] Just like that, I snuck backstage at a Chris Rock concert. Once I was behind the curtain, I was in my element. I knew where everything was. I knew where the food was, I knew where the dressing rooms were, where the bathrooms were… I’m walking around with a soda, people are coming up to me. “We didn’t know you were going to be here.” “I got a call last minute.” [laughter] “Looking for my keys.” [laughter] I says, “You know what, I got this far. I’m going to push it. I want to meet him.” I’ve always wanted to meet Chris Rock. It was not hard. Once I was back there, I just had to go to the dressing rooms. All I had to do was read the name on the door. I’m standing there, in front of the door, and I’m hyperventilating. [panting] [mimics knocking] The door opens up and there’s this man in there, this bodyguard who’s just massive. I’m a big guy, but damn, he was huge! As soon as he opened the door… [low-pitched growl] [mimics whooshing] [roaring] For real. Welcome to Jurassic– Big! Grandote. And I’m standing there and I’m like… “Hi.” And he’s like, “Can I help you?” “Yes, my name is Gabriel, I’m a comedian. And I wanted to see if I could say hi to Chris Rock if that’s possible.” “You say you comedian?” “Yes.” “Well, then you understand Chris is going over his material right now. He really ain’t trying to talk to nobody. So I’ll tell you what, player, if you want to come by after the show, You’re more than welcome to, but right now it’s not a good time. Chris Rock is a busy man.” [clicks tongue, sighs] [laughter] “Can I wave?” “Excuse me?” “Can I wave?” “What you mean?” “Can I wave to Chris? I don’t have to come in. Can I wave?” Chris Rock is in the room. He can hear the stupid conversation that’s taking place. [laughter] I know this because I can hear Chris Rock in the background. “What’s going on? Who’s at the door? Move out the way.” “Yo, Chris, I got this, man. I got this.” “Move!” “Alright.” The guy stands to the side. And now I’m looking at Chris Rock. And he recognized me. And it freaked me out. Oh, yeah, it freaked me out. He’s like, “Oh, shit! Look who it is. Look who it is. It’s the king of the Mexicans.” [laughter] Chris Rock called me the king of the Mexicans. For the rest of the show, everyone referred to me as “El Chapo.” I was celebrating the fact that I got away with that for so long. For so long! “I snuck backstage at Chris Rock! I snuck backstage, I snuck–“", "Until Karma showed up one day, in the form of the most extreme fan I have ever had in 20 years of me being a comedian. I had someone who not only made it backstage. This person paid to get into my dressing room. Okay? Yeah. He didn’t pay me, by the way. He didn’t pay me. I’m an honest hoe. Okay? I made no money that day, alright? If I had gotten paid, you wouldn’t be hearing this story. Here’s the thing. I walk into my dressing room from the bathroom. I just finished showering up and I’m in a towel. I walk into the room, come to find out later that this man was a very wealthy businessman in the community, okay? And when I walked into the room, he’s wearing a very, very nice suit. So when I saw the suit, I didn’t give it a second thought, because he looked professional. I thought maybe he was the general manager of the building, one of the concert promoters, he could have been someone’s agent… So when I walked in the room, in my towel, right, “Can I help you?” He looks at me and it was the most uncomfortable conversation I have ever had. He looks at me and says, “Listen. [inhales deeply, exhales] [laughter] I am not here to waste any of your time. Fluffy, I am prepared to take care of you. I will give you a new Lexus. And an allowance that’s more than what you make as a comedian. Leave with me.” [laughter] I was never more disgusted and offended at the fact that I was not gay. [laughter] Because finally! Finally, somebody wants to take care of me. [cheering, applause] Do you know how many people I take care of? No one’s ever offered me a Lexus, and they should. I felt horrible saying no to this guy. I still think about it. [laughter] I still have the number. [laughter]", "Houston, I’m going to tell you something, and I don’t know how this is going to go over, but I’m going to say it. I would be an amazing gay partner. [laughter] I would! All the way up until that one part, but even then. [laughter] Have you ever driven a Lexus? [laughter] Those are nice! Sometimes you got to take one for your own team. I’m just saying. [laughter] Now, in all seriousness, not to be funny, not to be disrespectful, let me tell you the reason why I would be an amazing gay partner. The level, the level of communication between two men is so high, I might actually get an answer. There might be clarity and understanding. I might hear a yes, I might hear a no. Do you know how many relationships I have been in where I still don’t know the outcome to certain conversations? [laughter] Very simple “yes or no” questions. That’s what I would do. Something as simple as… Bebé, you hungry? “Well… I haven’t eaten yet, so I probably should eat something, but I’m not feeling it right now. But if I don’t eat right now, you know how I’m gonna get later. So I guess it’s probably a good idea if I start eating right now, but it really depends on the options. What do you think?” Ah! What about this one? Bebé, where would you like to eat? [laughter] You hear all the guys? “Finally! I’m not alone!” Everybody’s pointing at somebody right now. Guys, am I right? This has to be– You would think that this is the safest question in the world to ask, but it’s not. “Well… Just pick something. You know me, I go with the flow. Whatever you decide is okay with me. You know me already, just pick something.” “Alright, we’re going to Burger King.” “I don’t like Burger King. Why do we got to go to Burger King? Burger King gives me chorro.” [laughter] Chorro is Mexican diarrhea. How about this one? “How do you feel?” “Really? Really? You want to know how I feel? Well, maybe if you’d pay attention from time to time, you might know how I feel. You might not need to have to ask me such a question, because you would already know exactly how I feel. You might have time and energy. I’m exhausted to let you know how I feel and you have the nerve to ask me ‘How do you feel?'”", "Now imagine the exact same conversation between me and Mr. Lexus. [laughter] Do you know how efficient that conversation would be? “Hey, bro! You hungry?” “I thought you’d never ask.” “What do you want to eat?” “Whatever you want to eat.” “We’re going to Burger King.” “I love Whoppers.” [laughter] “Me, too!” We go to Burger King and we tear it up. We get back home and I ask him, “Hey, how do you feel?” “Horny.” [laughter] “Me, too! How do you want to do this? Heads or tails?” [laughter] It would be efficient! [applause] This is hypothetical. But believe me, I still think about it, you know? Especially whenever I get into fights with my girl and she says something like, “Oh, you think you can do better?” I know I can have a Lexus. [laughter]", "I don’t know, man. I know we’re in the middle of a Netflix taping. Whoever is running the light up there, just want to make sure, ’cause I keep moving. And I stepped out of your light twice. Any other show, I’d be like, “No problem, no big deal.” But this is for Netflix. It’s the people that replaced Comedy Central. [crowd ooh’s] But no, I’ll try not to move too fast, but how slow are you if you can’t keep up with me? [laughter] You should work for Immigration. [laughter] I’m just giving you a hard time. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Ladies and gen– I apologize for that. Can we give a big round of applause to our person running the spotlight up there? [applause] I honestly don’t think that the people that work behind the scenes, like spotlight operators, get enough credit. Whether it’s spotlight operators, the people that run the cameras, the people that set up the stages, the people that work security, the people that run the building. Without them, there is no show. And the same thing goes with me. I got my own support team: managers, agents, promoters, you know, freaking merchandise people.", "I have a bus driver named ", ", who has never received any credit. And he’s been working for me for almost 10 years now. This man… [cheering and applause] This man has successfully gotten me to every single comedy show on time, without fail. [crowd cheering] If I had to describe him to you, okay? Dave looks like the word ‘Murica. [laughter] Not “America.” ‘Murica! He’s about six feet tall and he’s white. He has a gray beard and he wears a trucker hat. And he’s got to be one of the most hardworking people I have ever met. When I say hardworking, Hey, I’m on the road 46 weeks out of the year. So I know. The difference is I fly home every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Dave stays on that bus and he gets it to the next city, where we meet him. He works anniversaries, holidays, special moments. Christmas time, I was with my family. Dave was driving that bus on the East Coast. New Year’s, I was with my family. Dave was on the East Coast driving that bus. One of the hardest working people I’ve ever met. I just want to give a shout-out. [applause, cheering] In addition to being hardworking, he’s, uh– He’s very honest. When I say honest, I don’t mean “Oh, he does his taxes right.” I mean painfully honest. No-filter honest. He talks the way people used to. He does not have time to mince words. He just calls it like he sees it. Before me, he used to work with a man by the name of Kenny G. Grammy Award winner, amazing, amazing music. Um… one day, Kenny G was on his tour bus that Dave was driving, and I guess the two of them had a little discussion and Kenny G used some words that Dave would’ve rather him not have used. And instead of getting into it with him, this is what Dave does. [mimics engine, tires screeching] [brake hissing, door whooshing] Kicked Kenny G off of his own bus. [laughter] Because he would rather lose his job than lose his self-respect. And that’s the man I work with. [cheering, applause]", "He’s a bad dude. You guys are clapping, but you should’ve seen the interview. Oh, man, it was a good one. [laughs] He looks at me and he says, “Hey! Let’s get one thing straight. I don’t give a shit who you are. You treat me right, I’ll treat you right. You pay me on time, you’ll live. [laughter] Not to mention the fact that he keeps that tour bus squeaky clean. And he takes a lot of pride in that as well. One night, I was drinking on the bus, and I go to put my cup down. And I miss the table, and the cup hit the floor. I didn’t get up right away to get the cup, because I figured I’ll get up in a couple minutes and make myself another drink, I’ll pick up the cup then. Dave sees the cup on the floor, and then he looks at me and says, “Hey! I ain’t your mama. Pick that shit up!” [laughter] I get to the back of the bus and I’m like, “Wait a minute, I pay him.” “Hey, Dave…” “Shut up!” “Yeah, I’ll be in the back, in my room. Thank you. Drive safe.” And people tell me, “You work with a man who talks that way to you? Why?” Let me tell you why. Because he’s honest. With Dave, you know exactly what you get. Nowadays, it’s so hard for me to tell who’s being genuine and who has an agenda, and with him, you know exactly where you stand. If he likes you, he loves you. And if not, you’re on the curb with Kenny G. [laughter]", "That being said, I have a story to share. [scattered whooping] About a year and a half ago, maybe longer, we’re on the bus and we’re heading down the highway. [mimics bus thrumming] Just so you have kind of an understanding of the bus layout. Let’s say this is the front. Here’s Dave, the driver. Empty seat. And then a sliding door that goes in between him and the rest of the tour bus. My buddy Alfred and I are in the living room portion and we’re watching TV. We’re watching the news, and on the news, there’s this person who is running for some type of office. No particular office. [laughter] And I guess their big plan is to erect a structure… [laughter] …between two bodies of land. [laughter] Somewhere. And I guess they want one side of the structure to finance the entire project. Well, my buddy Alfred and I have a lot of family that works in construction and we know a bad job when we see one. So we started to voice our opinion out loud about how we felt about this person and what they wanted to do. We’re being very loud. So loud, Dave can hear us and then we hear Dave. [exaggerated laugh] “‘Murica.” [laughter] I yell out to Dave, I say, “Be quiet, Dave. This isn’t about you.” He taps a button on the dashboard that activates the sliding door. And when the door is about that far from closing, he yells out, “I’m building a wall.” [thud] [laughter] I couldn’t even get upset because I was too much in shock over the fact that that came out of someone four feet away from me. My buddy Alfred and I, we looked like chickens. We’re like… [clucking noises] My cell phone goes off. [mimics phone vibrating] I take out my phone and there’s a text message. From Dave. [laughter] And I said, “That’s right. He better say, ‘I’m sorry.’ He better say, ‘Just kidding.'” I open up the text message and it says, “And you’re paying for it.” [laughter, applause] And people tell me, “You still work with him after that?” Yes, I do. I trust that man with my life every single night. I know where his heart’s at. He can say whatever he wants. At the end of the day, he still has to drive around the king of the Mexicans. [laughter] [whooping, applause]", "The point to this story is just because you have a difference in opinion, it doesn’t mean that you can’t have respect for one another, you can’t have love for one another, that you can’t have incredible friendships with one another. It’s our differences that make us special. What a lot of us need to work on is our delivery. It’s all in the way you say things. That’s why text messages are always misinterpreted. ‘Cause you read the text according to how you feel. “What does he mean, ‘Hello’?” Yeah. Anyway, Dave has gotten us to 48 of the 50 states. He doesn’t travel with us outside of America. He prefers it that way. Last year, we got a chance to do a European tour of 15 countries. Estonia, Germany, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, UK… We’re just bouncing around all over the place. And then we wound up on the other side of the world.", "\nOut of all the countries I performed in, my favorite country outside of home is ", ". And I’ll tell you why. Australia, much like us in America, has its list of priorities. You know what’s not on their list? Political correctness. They do not care about your feelings. It’s like a country full of Daves. [laughter] Believe it or not, it’s very refreshing to be around such a large group of people who speak their minds so freely. And if you know that before you go there, you’re going to have an amazing time, but if you don’t know that and you show up, it is a culture shock and a half, because I showed up and I didn’t know. Everybody says you got to see the beaches and I went to the beach. I had people coming up to me. “Hey! Somebody help me get him back in the water.” [laughter] “Yeah, right there, big fella. Look at you, right there. Oh, wait, he’s moving. He’s moving, he’s moving. Oh, he’s crying! He’s crying! I bet it tastes like gravy.” [laughter] It’s not bullying if everyone does it.", "Yeah, that being said, I’m in Australia. Sydney, Australia, at the Opera House, for me, was one of the most iconic places I’ve ever got to perform in and it was bucket list, definitely. After the show, I want to go hang out with some Aussies see what that was like. I’m hanging out at a pub. First things first. Australian people do not drink Foster’s beer. That’s an American thing. They don’t drink that over there. I tried ordering one to fit in, didn’t go over well. Bartender looked at me, “You like the taste of piss, do ya?” [laughter] “Okay, don’t order that again.” So I’m hanging out with these two Aussies and we’re drinking a rum called Bundaberg. At first glance, it looks like a Coca-Cola bottle because there’s a polar bear on the front and then you drink it and you’re like, “That’s not Coke.” [laughter] As we’re talking, a third Australian joined the conversation, and he sounded a little bit different from the other two. He had more of a raspy voice. More like… [growls indistinctly] He sounded like a drunk pirate underwater. [laughter] These two guys didn’t like him, so they called him a name and they left, and now it’s just me and drunk pirate. We’re talking about life. Life in America, life in Australia, talking about our differences. He tells me that he’s a professional knife maker. He’s showing me how it’s done, he’s showing me pictures. We wind up polishing off three bottles of this rum. And drunk wasn’t even the right word to describe our level. My tour manager Ryan, he comes up to me and he says, “Gabe, time to go.” And I look at Ryan and I’m like, “But Ryan, I just made a friend and he makes knives and they’re pretty.” My tour manager always knows how to talk to me no matter what condition I’m in. If I’m drunk, he knows better than to talk to me like I’m an adult. He talks to me like I’m two. He looks at me and he says, “Hey, buddy. [laughter] You hungry? [laughter] Well, listen, if we don’t leave right now, they’re gonna close McDonald’s and you’re going to have to eat at the airport.” I gotta go. “Alright, mate, you gotta go, you gotta go. No worries.” And he goes to shake my hand. And when he shook my hand, he put his personal pocket knife that he made in my hand as a gift. “That’s for you, mate. Thanks for being nice.” “Thank you! Thank you! I’ll cut cheeseburgers with this.” [laughter]", "We leave, and we head to the restaurant. [mimics engine] The manager at the restaurant recognized me. He’s a big fan. And he said, “Hey, stay as long as you like.” Shouldn’t have said that. The plan was do the show, go have some drinks, get a bite to eat, go to the hotel, shower up and then go to the airport. We stayed so long at the restaurant, we had to go straight to the airport. So we get there, and you don’t sober up in like two hours, after three bottles of rum. I was not in airport condition. [laughter] And so my tour manager has one hand on each shoulder, right? Ryan’s trying to push me through the airport, and, you know, he’s about 190. I’m not. [laughter] And he’s pushing me with everything. [laughter] And he gets me all the way to airport security. And airport security in Australia, you don’t have to take off your shoes, and I didn’t worry about taking off a belt because I don’t wear a belt, ’cause I have a butt. So he lines me up with airport security and he tells me, “I got to let you go.” “Don’t let me go.” “I got to let you go.” “Don’t let me go!” And then he pushed me, and I’m going forward. And he yells out, “You’re a plane!” and the two-year-old came out. “I’m a plane!” [laughter, applause] And now this Fluffy 747 is headed right for the metal detector, and I can see the security officer on the other side. [laughter] And when I got really close, Ryan yells out, “Wings down! Wings down!” And I went through and I didn’t touch the edges, but when I went through… [beep] -[man in the crowd] The knife. -[crowd gasps] I sobered up for half a second because I realized, Oh, my God, I forgot to check the knife that the guy gave me and it’s on me and I’ve already cleared the freaking… You know… So I’m like… The security officer does this. “Eh, go ahead.” [laughter] Houston, sober me would have internally celebrated the fact that I am not going to prison for sneaking a knife past airport security and boarding a flight. Drunk me was offended. [laughter] Oh, you can ask my buddy, Ryan was right behind me. I looked at the security officer and I said, “Hey! Hey! How do you know? How do you know I’m not a terrorist?” And I can hear my friends in line. “Fuck!” [laughter] The security officer in uniform, wearing a badge, looks at me and says, “Hey, when have you ever seen a fat terrorist?” [laughter] “Eh, look at him. He’s crying. I bet it tastes like gravy.” [laughter]", "Yeah. -You guys, I gotta tell you– -[man] We love you, Fluffy! What happened, bro? [man] We love you! Do you have a Lexus? [laughter] ‘Cause I’m not passing that up again. [laughter] [laughing] Sorry. I just– But thank you. [laughing] Actually, I’ve had some pretty awesome times over the last 20 years. And whenever I talk to fans, they have certain questions about my past, whether it’s my family, my upbringing, where my mom came from, where my dad came from… Certain stories. I love the fact that I had someone ask me one time, “In your 20-plus years as a comedian, what has been your greatest moment?” My greatest moment wasn’t even something that happened at a show, but it was because of what I was able to do for someone very special to me. My mom, who is no longer with us, she meant everything to me. She was my biggest supporter, even though she would never laugh at my jokes. She would get mad at her friends that wouldn’t laugh. -“¿Pendejo, por que no te ríes?” -[laughter] How come you don’t laugh?", "I did something really awesome for my mom before she passed away. I took her to go see a man by the name of ", ". [crowd cheering] In concert. now if you’re not familiar with who Vicente Fernandez is, he is basically Mexican Elvis. But he’s still alive. [laughter] So a few years ago, Vicente Fernandez and myself were both performing at the same venue, a venue called the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. It is no longer there. A woman by the name of Emily was running the building. I was there the week before Vicente Fernandez, and after three sold-out shows she comes up to me and says, “Gabriel, thank you so much for this incredible business. We’re so happy with how the shows turned out. I have a question for you. Is your mom a fan of Vicente Fernandez?” I said, “Emily, my mom’s Mexican. [laughter] It’s the law.” [laughter] “I thought so. Listen, Vicente Fernandez is going to be performing here next week. And I wanted to do something very special for you to show my appreciation. Do you think you and your mom would like to come see him perform and I’ll get you front-row center?” I said, “Emily, that sounds amazing. I’m pretty sure the answer is yes, but my mom is old school, so I still got to ask. I’ll call you.” So I get to my mom’s house, and I see her. “Mama.” “Dime, mi hijo.” Mi hijo in Spanish means “my son.” So my mom would always tell me that, my son, mi hijo. Mi hijo. “Dime, mi hijo.” “Tell me, my son.” I said, “Mom, would you like to go see Vicente Fernandez in concert?” And she looked at me and said, “Mi hijo, that sounds nice.” That’s exactly how she said it. She was very even-keeled. She wouldn’t show a lot of emotion. So I call Emily and I said my mom’s in. “Awesome. I’ll see you next week.” So we get to the venue and we’re early, so they have us in this little VIP section where they’re giving us free drinks and free snacks, and my mom was so cute. She walks up to me and she says, “Mi hijo, are the drinks free?” I said, “Mom, yeah, the drinks are free, but don’t worry about it.” “No, no, no, mi hijo, I didn’t bring any money. I don’t have no money.” I said, “Mom, you made an ATM. You’re good.” [laughter] [cheering, applause] The messed up part is that she didn’t even like drinking. She just wanted to walk around with a couple of drinks so she’d look like she was part of the party. -[laughter] -You know? So she’s got a couple drinks, and as it was, when she’d walk around, she’d have a little bit of a limp, because she had just had toe surgery a couple months prior. So she had kind of like a little– It looked like she was dancing. [vocalizing] So she’s walking around. Here comes Emily. “Gabriel, you made it!” I go, “Yeah, this is my mom. Emily, this is my mom, Esther. Mom, this is Emily.” “They’re free!” “She knows they’re free. She made this happen.” “Oh, thank you, thank you! You’re the one who hired mi hijo. Gracias. Thank you so much.” Emily goes, “Can I talk to you for a second?” “Sure. Mom, I’ll be right back. What’s up, Emily?” “Gabriel, do you think your mom would you like to meet Vicente Fernandez right now?” I said, “Emily, let me tell you something… [laughter] …if she says no, I want to meet him. [laughter] I’ll be right back.” “Mamá.” “Dime, mi hijo”. Emily wants to know if you would like to meet Vicente Fernandez right now. “Mi hijo, that sounds nice.” “Alright. Emily, she’s in.” Emily goes, “Is she even a fan?” I go, “Trust me, that’s her reaction. She’s good. She has the whole house covered with Vicente Fernandez records and cassettes. Okay? We’re good.” So Emily comes back. And she puts the special VIP bracelets on us with a little click, and she walks us through a door into the backstage area. As soon as we went through the door, I knew exactly where we were. I was just there a week ago. So I got my mom arm in arm, and we’re walking down the hallway, okay? Come on, Mama. Let’s go. Let’s go. We’re walking down the hallway, and we’re getting closer and closer to Vicente Fernandez’s dressing room. The door is wide open, and I can hear a commotion coming out of the dressing room. [shrieking] And then a man and a woman exit the room and the man is holding on to the woman’s shoulders and he’s like, “It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s okay, it’s okay.” And the woman looks destroyed. Okay? [wailing] Mascara is running down her face. My mom sees that and she’s like, “Mi hijo, did you see that? Did you see the mascara… [shrieks] With the mascara– Parece puta la cabrona.” [laughter] Sorry. Puta means “friendly.” [laughter] So we get by the door, and the closer we get, we start to see a guy in the room. Then he comes to the door. In the room, there’s three people, okay? There’s Vicente Fernandez, the photographer and a handler. The handler comes to the door, and you can tell by his voice that he works for like a Mexican radio station, ’cause he’s got that voice. “Hola! Hola! Pasale! Pasale!” Pasale in Spanish means “come on in.” So we start to walk into the room. And let me tell you guys something, If you grew up listening to Vicente Fernandez from a young age, and you get the opportunity to meet him, it is seriously a religious experience. My mom and I are entering the room, the only thing missing is the freaking… [imitates cleric speaking Latin] [laughter] You don’t look at him. You look at the floor. Out of respect, you just look at the floor. “Come on, Ma”. We get all the way up to him and I see boots. And when I see the boots, my mom and I both just… [laughter] He knows what you’re doing. He knows you’re checking him out. So what he does is he poses, okay? Vicente stands there and he poses. He’ll have the sombrero, the hat, to his side. And then, he doesn’t look at you. He looks away. [laughter] And he sticks his chest out and he stands there looking like a big-ass bottle of Tapatio at Costco. [laughter] [applause] And then he looked at me. [mimics whooshing] And he recognized me. not as a comedian, but because I was there the week before and my photo was hanging outside his door. It was whoever is there last, they always rotate the photo. So he sees me and he’s like, “Mi hijo, tu eres el muchacho que esta en la foto ahí afuera.” “Yeah, that’s me outside, yeah. Hola!” [laughter] “Oh. Vicente, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Le presento… mi mamá!” [laughter] I’m like, “Oh, my God. I think I just offered up my mom to Vicente Fernandez.” [laughter] She’s like 73. “Better late than never, Mom, get him!” My mom starts walking up to, Vicente. He was so nice. He goes out to shake my mom’s hand and my mom grabs his hand. And I don’t know where she got this strength and energy from, but she grabbed him and pulled him in. Hard, like the video game. “Get over here!” And then hooked him. She hooked him and she starts screaming into his chest. “Mi Chente!” I’m like, “Oh, my God. She’s getting horny.” [laughter] And he knew, too! ‘Cause he was like, “Quitamela! Quitamela!” The photographer, the handler and me. The three of us is what it took to pull her off of Vicente. We sit her down, she’s bawling. [wailing] Mascara is running down her face. [laughter] The photographer shaking his head. I guess Vicente had dinner earlier that night. He was eating barbecue, ’cause they had those wet naps. Barbecue wet naps. And so we take the wet naps and we start cleaning the mascara off my mom’s face. We stand her up. We posed her and we took the picture. Emily comes over and she takes us and she escorts us to our seats in the front. And for three hours… for three hours, my mom was on her feet listening to him and she refused to sit down. “Mom, you should sit down–” “No, ¿cómo qué? És el Chente.” Holding a shot of tequila that she never drank. [laughter] She just– She was– [laughter] Three hours on her feet. Never once sat down. That’s how powerful his music was. [applause] My mom felt no pain for that entire time. And the minute that freaking concert was over, “Tan-taran, tan-tan.” “My feet! Oh, my God, mi hijo, mis pies. Ay, pinche callo. “Oh, my God, my feet! Ay!” And I’m like, “Oh, great.” So now I gotta drag this living novela to the parking lot. I helped her into the car. “My feet!” “I told you to sit down.” “You don’t sit for Chente.” Here comes Emily. “Did you guys have a good time?” I go, “Emily, we had the greatest time. Thank you so much.” “I got something for you.” Oh, what’s that? And she hands me an envelope and I open it, and inside the envelope is the picture. She printed it out for me, and when I looked at it I got so choked up because I have never seen my mom so happy in a picture. And it’s not that she wouldn’t smile. She would smile, but it was that “one, two, three, cheese.” [laughter] But this one was like… [laughter] And what makes it extra special is that it’s the last photo I have of my mom and she was the happiest. And I know that that moment wouldn’t be possible if I did not do this for a living. [applause] So thank you for that. Sorry, now a lot of people are like, “We came to laugh…” -[mumbling indistinctly in Spanish] -[laughter]", "Houston, I got to share this story. Twenty years ago, when I started doing this, okay, the fact that we’re here tonight in an arena doing a comedy special is huge, but everything… Everything has a beginning. The fact that I can travel and I meet so many people, “we are your fans,” “we are your fans,” and social media shows over 10 million, everything comes from somewhere. And the fact that tonight I have in the audience my first two fans that ever came out to see one of my shows, I flew them out from Los Angeles to be here tonight. [cheering and applause] Monica, Tony, where you guys at? There you are. Ladies and gentlemen… [crowd cheering] …Monica and Tony Sanchez. When I say they were my first fans, they were my first, they would come out… I used to perform in her garage. And she’ll tell you. Oh, yeah. Right next to the Ford. [laughter] They were the first ones. They were the first ones to come see me perform at a little dive– hole-in-the-wall inside of a casino in California. And, um… You know, to have met these people so many years ago and they’d come out, she would tell me with her husband, “You were so funny, we’ll be back next week.” I’m like, “But it’s the same 5-minute show.” She goes, “You’re funny, we’ll bring more people. We’ll bring more people. She was my first fan club. She would get friends and bring them out to the show. [applause] And she has pictures of me in that garage. I wish you wouldn’t put them online, but you do. [laughter] But I just wanted to say thank you, guys, and I’m glad you could be here tonight. Twenty years doing this, so I think it’s only right that tonight we close this show the way that the first one began. [cheering, applause] I get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-thru. You better still laugh, Houston! I made a left turn instead of making a right turn but I wasn’t paying attention ’cause I had a box, right? I was like, “You’re going to get it when you get home, you’ve been so bad! So bad! [screams] Gonna get it!” I’m not paying attention, I go the wrong way. [mimics car turning] Sure enough… [mimics siren chirping] Oh! [tires screech] Later. [mumbling] The officer is taking forever. I said, “Forget this, he’s taking too long.” I grab my box, I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. Hmm! [laughs] Hmm… [shrieks] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window. “You know why I stopped you?” It was too easy. -I said, “‘Cause you could smell it!” -[crowd] …could smell it! [cheering and applause] Keep going! [crowd exclaims] -Houston, keep going! -[crowd] Yeah! I should have started the show like this, okay? Um, I bought a Volkswagen Beetle about seven years ago. [crowd cheering] And when you buy a new car, you want to show it off, whether it’s brand new or just new to you. So I take my car to my friend Martin’s house. You’ve seen Martin. Very real. I pull up. [mimics tires screeching] I yell out the window, -Mar– -[crowd, in unison] Martin! [cheering, applause] [whooping] You don’t need me anymore. [laughter] That’s freaking awesome! Thank you. Love you, too. Hold on, hold on. I forgot the joke. Hold on. [laughter] I know how it starts and I know how it ends. I’m just not used to starting from the middle. [laughter] That’s what she said. No, just– [laughter] Stop. You deserve better than that. Um… Martin… lives in a bad neighborhood. I don’t get out of the car. Across the street from his house live these gang members, the kind of gang members who don’t really hurt anybody. They just talk a lot of trash and watch Frozen. [laughter] And I pull up in a Beetle. [mimics tires screeching] [all in unison] Martin! Across the street, I hear… [all in unison] Órale! [cheering and applause] Let me finish! [laughter] -Someone said, “That’s what she said.” -[laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Hey, hey. [clicks tongue] Ah! I turn around. “Hey, what’s up, you guys? How’s it going?” “How did you get in there, ese?” “Hurry up, Martin!” A couple of months go by. I fix up the car. I put racing rims on it, some stickers. I put little chip in the motor to make it go faster. Two hundred and fifty horsepower Volkswagen Beetle. The car is bad. I pull up. [mimics driving, tires screeching] [engine revving] -[horn honking] -[laughter] [all in unison] Martin! [all in unison] Órale! Some of you are drunk. [laughter] This is what I just heard. I heard… “Órale!” “Le!” Keep up! I know it’s Mexicans too. I hear the accent. I hear that– [mumbles indistinctly mocking Mexican accent] Even the white people are like, “Hello! It’s odalay.” [laughter] “Get it together.” Keep up! -Eh. -[crowd] Eh. [all in unison] Eh. [all in unison] Yoo-hoo! “What?” [all in unison] “Check it out, eh, it’s the Fat and the Furious!” I heard you, Houston! [cheering and applause] I heard you. You guys were saying the joke with me like it was a song. Like it was the Mexican version of Freebird. [laughter] Keep going! [crowd roars] Keep going! [crowd roars] Chills.", "My son Frankie, when he graduated from high school, I was very, very proud of him and I was very excited. And, uh… For me, it was very emotional, because I was the one that got to take him to school on that last day, and it meant a lot, because you know what? [laughs] I was allowed to leave him anywhere I wanted to. I can leave him in the front. I can leave him on the side. I can put him in the back. I can make him walk. That wasn’t the case many years ago, when I was taking him to elementary school. And they had a designated drop-off area on the side of the school, where they had cones in the middle of the street. They had a supervisor there with a walkie-talkie and a whistle to make sure that your kids would get out of the car safely and onto the school grounds. One day we’re late because the night before I had a big show like this one. And people brought me chocolate cakes. And I took the cakes home and my son killed one of the cakes. And the next day, the cake… [mimics stomach rumbling] …killed Frankie. [laughter] Oh, it was bad. [mimics high-pitched fart] Chorro! Chocomilk! For the non-Mexicans: Yoo-hoo! [laughter] For the non-Mexicans with money: Nestle Quik! [laughter] Same joke. We get to the school. There’s no longer supervisor, no walkie-talkie, no whistle, the gate’s locked. I said, “I’m not leaving my kid here.” I’m going to drop him off in front. And I guess I wasn’t supposed to do that and I didn’t know, and at the time, I didn’t really care. We pull up. [mimics car driving, tires screeching] “Go.” “I’m not supposed to get off here.” “You’re late. Go.” [groans] And he cracks the door. And as soon as his foot hits the curb, here comes the principal. And I know who it is, ’cause he’s freaking out, right? He’s like… [whispering] “It’s the principal!” “Dude, relax. I’m 32, I don’t give a damn!” [laughter] Here comes the principal and she’s doing this one. [high-pitched voice] “Sir! Sir! Sir, this is not the designated drop-off area. Please take your child to the other side of the school. You cannot leave him here.” I was like, “Watch this.” Señora, no sé lo que esta diciendo. Aqui estoy dejando a mi hijo. El no se levantó a la mañana. It’s not my fault. Yo no sé. “That’s how you do it, homeboy. That’s how you do it.” That principal was awesome because she was like, [American accent] Usted no puede dejar su hijo aqui. Okay? [American accent] Saca la vuelta al otro lado de la escuela. Okay? [all in unison] Allá, si, si. Aqui, no, no. [all in unison] Allá, si, si. Aqui, no, no. [all in unison] Yo no soy pendeja! [laughter, applause] Monica, Tony. Twenty years ago, when I was in your garage, if you would’ve told me this was going to happen I’d have said you’re crazy. If you would have told me, “Twenty years from now people are going to come out and fill up arenas to see you. They’re going to cheer for you, and they’re going to finish your jokes… in Houston, Texas.” [crowd cheering, applauding] This special is dedicated to both of you and to this city. That’s Houston strong. Thank you very much, and you have a great night! And I hope I keep making you proud. Thank you.

[cheering and applause continues] Now, I’ve got my father here. [cheering] And he’s planning the whole day today. He wanted to do lunch. He’s like, “Let’s go to the freedom thing. -Take a look at that. -[laughter] Maybe we go to Central Park.” I go, “Dad, I’m– I’m playing Radio City tonight. I got shit going on.” [laughter] He goes, “What, are you too big now? Big shot! [laughter] You’re a biggie, biggie shot. You can’t go out to lunch with your father? [laughter] Biggie, biggie shot.” [laughter]", "Came in on Wednesday, and it was… I don’t know what’s going on on these airplanes. Looks like a farm on the airplane now with the amount of animals coming down the aisle. [laughter] When did this…? Okay. Why– why is it okay to just bring the dog, a parrot. [laughter] You see a couple months ago, at the Newark Airport? Some idiot tried to bring a peacock. [laughter] She had a peacock on her shoulder, walking into the airport, like it was TUMI luggage. I mean, what? [laughter] The thing fell off. She’s trying to gather it. [laughter] When these people leave the house, anybody say anything to them? [laughter] If I left the house with a peacock on my back, someone would come up to me, “Where the fuck you going with that? [laughter] You gonna bring it on an airplane? What are you, nuts?” [laughter]", "There was a fight on my airplane. We couldn’t even take off. Someone got their ass kicked on the flight. I mean… This is happening on a weekly basis. Just do what you’re told. That’s how I grew up. Just do what you’re told. What’s with the lip? [laughter] If I’m on an airplane and four stormtroopers get on my plane with flak jackets on… that say “Security”, and they come right to my row and tell me, “Hey, you’re gonna have to get up…” I’m up! [laughter] I take my bag, my cup of coffee… “I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry. Do I just pick up my voucher here and wait 14 days for the next flight? That sounds totally fair to me. Just don’t kick my ass. I am sorry I interrupted everybody’s vacation. Let me just make my way off the fuselage.” [laughter] What are you gonna do? Fight someone nowadays? This– this is not 20 years ago, where you’re at a nightclub and some guy gives you a little… Remember those days, some guy would just kind of lean his shoulder right into your chestplate. [laughter] [mouthing] Come on. [laughter] “You want some of this, huh? Hold my cologne. You want to do this?” [laughter]", "Back then you got into a fist fight. Maybe you got a black eye. Maybe. That’s all people knew how to do, was to punch. Now… You don’t know what this guy knows with this Mixed Martial Arts. [laughter] This MMA. This guy will end up on your back with his heels into your nuts, choking you out. [laughter] How do you defend that? I mean… [laughter] These MMA guys, that’s a different guy. That’s a tough man. They don’t punch. They’ll kick– They’ll kick your leg off. [laughter] They train on banana trees. Just kicking down a banana tree. How do you think your leg’s gonna hold up? [laughter] Could you… Honest to God, could you withstand a strike to the peroneal nerve from a 23-year-old grown man? I can’t. [laughter]", "I can’t take nothing. I got up last night at 3:00 in the morning to go take a piss, I stubbed my toe. Down for 58 minutes. [laughter] You ever stub your toe at night? [laughter] You don’t even want to look down. You’re like, “I know the nail came off. The nail came off and one toe is busted. I just want to take a piss. I’ll find the nail in the morning and I’ll wipe the blood off the sheets. This is ridiculous. God, the pain.” [laughter]", "You can’t fight an MMA guy. That’s a tough guy. That’s a tough life. [laughter] They got a strudel for an ear. What is this… what is that? [laughter] There’s nothing I could do to this guy that hurts more than a strudel hanging off the left side of the cranium. [laughter] Watch how they come into the ring. They’re just… [laughter] …stretching out their teeth. Oh, my God. If I was his opponent, I’m like, “This is it. I’m gonna die tonight. This guy’s gonna… kill me.” I’m not fighting nobody. I’m barely working out at this age. I’ve been doing the same workout since ’89. [laughter] I just go to the gym. Couple biceps, some chest. I start beading, I get the hell out of the gym. [laughter] I ain’t sweating through clothing. Those days are done. [laughter] Maybe if I’m feeling good, I’ll hit the treadmill. I did that last week. I got on my treadmill there, and there’s eight empty treadmills next to me. So, I put it on 5.0. Now, it’s not too high. It’s not too slow. It’s a valet jog. Let me go get your Mercedes. [laughter] Another guy comes right next to me, on the treadmill next to me, right? Eight treadmills, he’s gotta pick this one. [laughter]", "This is the problem with me. I can’t pay attention to what I’m doing. I’m honed in on everyone else. Especially if they get near me, I start looking at what this guy is up to. I’m giving him a side view. [laughter] And he’s not starting the machine. I’m getting bothered. I’m like, “Guy, start your machine. You’re screwing up what I’m doing over here.” [laughter] He’s stretching out… on the treadmill. Now, listen. There’s a place for this in the gym. There’s a stretch-out area. Okay, I don’t go to the stretch-out area and run around people. [laughter] You don’t bring your stretch to the mill. [laughter] So, you ever look at a treadmill? They’ve got a bunch of different compartments. I always wondered… who’s using all this storage? [laughter] This is the guy. They built the treadmill for him. This guy’s emptying his life into these little bins. The change, the iPhone… the wallet, the keys. He brought an iPad. He brought a cinema… to the gym. [laughter] Then he put his little bitch-buds in, right? [laughter] Then he cranked it up to 15. I didn’t even know the damn thing went this high. [laughter] The manufacturer said, “Yeah, leave it at 15. No one’s going to do that.” But this guy’s sprinting. Fast. Do you ever see people on a treadmill? They run fast and hard, like the whole gym could hear them run? It’s like… [imitates thudding] Like a sock… is gonna fly off at any minute. [laughter] Then he pulled this one. He just rested on the side, and let the thing… [laughter] Just do what we are doing. Don’t do some weird work out that you saw… [laughter] Then he… I’ve never seen this before. He had like a water backpack… [laughter] …like, that you would see in the desert. He had a backpack filled with water, and then a tube… [laughter] …that he could just sip. [laughter] Then he dropped it down. Then he pulled this one. He turned towards me. Now he starts side skipping. Oh, my God. [laughter] I cannot run on a treadmill with another grown man looking right at me. [laughter] Doing side skips. [laughter] I came home, I told my wife this story. She don’t get it. She don’t understand. She’s like, “Why do you look at everybody? Just do you.” “Why do you look at the whole gym?” I go, “‘Cause that’s what makes me happy. I like to be bothered.” [laughter] She says, “Come with me. I’m gonna spin class tomorrow.” I say, “Okay, I’ll come. I’ll come to your spin class.”", "I’ve never done this before. But I went to SoulCycle, -whatever it is, right? -[cheering] Yeah, see, everybody gets so hopped up. [laughter] I go to the one in LA, everybody’s fake positive. All right? They come into the class, “What’s going on? How’s it going? Are we gonna do this today?” Okay. Relax. Relax. It’s a class. It’s a spin class. [laughter] So right away, I’m bothered. I go, “Babe, I gotta get out of here. I can’t– I can’t do this.” Already I’m upset. [laughter] She like, “Come on, let’s go check in and get our shoes. I said, “Shoes? What is this? A bowling alley?” [laughter] Everybody’s got these special spin shoes. So they’re all walking around… [laughter] “I’m on Bike 22. Could you tell me where bike… Okay, it’s over here? Great.” [laughter] So, we signed up late. My wife and I did not have bikes together. My wife starts panicking. She’s like, “Babe, we’re not doing this together. I’m on the other side of the room. I have to ask the girl next to you.” I go, “Babe, don’t start doing this shit. The girl next to me is already set up. She’s got a water bottle, everything’s in place. Do not ask her anything.” I go, “Babe, we’re not gonna talk during this. It’s a 45-minute class. We’re not gonna, like… I’m not gonna turn to you and go, ‘Did you pay the gas bill?’ This is a workout. [laughter] We’re not gonna hold hands on the bike. This is not a ride through Central Park. This is a stationary bike.” [laughter] So I start to work out. The class didn’t even start. I just started on my own thing. I ain’t waiting. If I’m there, let’s get the thing going. I’m cooking. [laughter] So now the teacher comes in. This guy was way too happy for what was happening in the room. [laughter] He’s one of these, like, real positive teachers. He’s like, “All right, everybody. Are you ready? It’s a Monday morning. Put your head down. Let’s get rid of that mean boss that keeps bitching at you every time you come in. Let’s get rid of that debt that you have. Let’s shed that cousin that didn’t come to the holiday dinner.” I’m like, “Gee, how bad is it in here for these people? I’m just here to get rid of the cheesecake I had last night, not the abusive father. What the hell is going on?” [laughter]", "But my wife grew up, like, very athletic… She grew up in a family where they just– they have a lot of time on that side. They’ve got a lot of money… So nobody’s doing anything really, you know? [laughter] Everybody’s really relaxed. [laughter] Like, when I went over there for the first time, I was meeting my wife’s family, and, like, everybody was home. [laughter] Like, on a Tuesday at 2:30. I go, “Why is everybody… home?” [laughter] Like, no one works over there. They just, you know. I’m like, “What do your cousins do?” “I-I don’t know, really. I don’t, uh, really know what they do. I think… they’re in advertising, but I don’t really know what they do.” [laughter]", "They’re so relaxed. They’re the type of family that when they graduated college, they took a year off to go find themselves. Do you know people like this? They graduate and they go backpacking through Europe and stay at hostels like they’re broke. [laughter] They go find themselves. That shit don’t fly on my side. [laughter] When I graduated college, I couldn’t tell my father, “Dad, I’m gonna go to Europe to go find myself.” [laughter] “What do you mean, go find yourself? [laughter] I found you, you’re right here in my house. Where are you gonna go? [laughter] You want to see you? Go look in the mirror. You got no job and you’re in my house. I found you. You’re here.” [laughter]", "My wife’s side is like really happy and they encourage things. [laughter] Right? They, like, do retreats as a family. They– they work on their inner self. “We work on our inner self.” [laughter] They do therapy. My– my family don’t do any of this. No therapy, no bettering… It’s like, “This is it. What are you going to do? Change? This is you.” [laughter] No one’s popping pills on my side. Nobody’s on antidepressants. My father’s like, “I’ve been depressed for 30 years!” [laughter] We just handle our problems in the house. We didn’t broadcast our problems. My father was like, “Shh, don’t tell nobody what’s going on in here. Okay?” [laughter] Even within our family there was, like, secrets. No one said anything. My grandfather had polio. He had one leg significantly shorter than the other leg. Nobody said nothing. I– Nobody mentioned he had a disease. [laughter] My whole childhood I was just like, “Okay, that’s the way men from Sicily walk.” [laughter] I asked my father one day. I said, “What’s wrong with Grandpa?” “What do you mean what’s wrong? Why would you say that about your grandfather? What do you mean what’s wrong with him?” “I don’t know,  he’s got a two by four nailed to his heel. I-I don’t– I’ve never seen a shoe like that. I– [laughter] Nobody’s saying anything about the man’s shoes.” [laughter]", "I don’t know. My… My family. My father, my mother, man. They know me back and forth. They can tell if anything is wrong with me, if I’m feeling a certain way. My father would walk right in my house, look right in my eyes, “Hey, drunk? Fucked up? [laughter] What’s wrong with you. Your eyes. Something’s wrong.” [laughter] He’s like upset that I had two drinks. “You drink? You drink a little?” [laughter] That’s why I’m shocked to hear these parents today have no idea what their kids are doing. Right? You hear it on the news all the time. “We had no idea.” [laughter] Kid’s in his room with 16 bazookas, 19 grenades. He’s going to school dressed as Darth Vader. You know? Look– look in the room! [laughter] It starts at the house. [cheering and applause] Growing up, my mother lived in my room constantly, just looking for shit. [laughter] My mom knew what I was doing when I was a teenager. She would come downstairs with a towel. She was like, “Hey, I found this in your room. [laughter] You’re sick. You’re sick. [laughter] You owe me a whole new set of towels. [laughter] I can’t get this out. [laughter] No son of mine is gonna do that in my house.” [laughter]", "My wife’s side is so different, man. [laughter] My wife is always happy. She’s– Even when bad things go wrong, she’s always with a smile, this woman. She came home… came home last month. She was like, “Babe, I don’t know what happened, but… [laughter] I was backing out of the parking lot at the mall, and I just sideswiped a cement pylon. [laughs] It’s just a graze. It’s a small graze. You could probably buff it out or use some Carnauba Wax to just… You know?” [laughter] Now, my immediate reaction is to yell. That’s– that’s how I grew up. High volume. [laughter] I’d come home with a flat tire on my bicycle, and my father would be like, “What the fuck is this?” [laughter] “I don’t know! [laughter] I didn’t see the nail!” [laughter] My wife grew up with a mother that was more forgiving. “Accidents happen. [laughter] Just as long as you were not injured, we could always replace it.” [laughter] My father was like, “Guess who’s walking this summer? [laughter] Can’t get you nothing nice.” [laughter]", "So now I can’t yell– I can’t yell at my wife. She does not respond to yelling. Last time I raised my voice, she gave it right back to me. She’s like, “I don’t know what this is, but you better bring this down, and let’s talk like adults and resolve it. Okay, let’s just resolve it. I think you need some therapy. You and your father should get in some type of group retreat… for your condition. I don’t know.” [laughter] So, I can’t yell. I got to push it. I got to push this shit deep. I– [laughter] I don’t even know who I am anymore. I-I don’t even sound like me. [laughter] I’m sitting in the kitchen like, “Yeah, okay. It’s just a graze, then. [laughter] I think I could probably buff it out. If you said it’s a graze… it’s a graze. [laughter] Could we go to the driveway to look at what you call a graze is? Because I’d love to… [laughter] …know in your head what you think that is.” [laughter] She’s like, “Yeah, no, I’ll show you.” So both of us go out to the driveway. I’m like, “We need a new door!” [laughter] [mouthing] I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s me. It’s me. Wow. My wife doesn’t know what’s involved in an accident. That’s my assignment now. That’s six weeks now that I had to deal with this headache. Calling the insurance, telling them, “Listen, don’t spike up the… It’s a graze. Here, I–” [laughter] I’ve got to go rent a car, sign my life away on 123 pages for a Nissan Altima. [laughter] I gotta go to a body shop. You ever go there? Man, they’re waiting for you to pull in. What are you gonna do, fix it at your garage? You do body work? I know nobody that does this. I’ve got to go in. You go to a body shop, everybody comes out, the whole– the whole garage. [laughter] When you pull in, they have a guy that’s like, “Hey, we got one Let’s take a look at it.” [laughter] And they swarm the car. They just… I thought I was in a Cirque du Soleil show. They were… [laughter] Then they call out the head guy, he’s the best actor they got. [laughter] “Frankie, you want to take a look at this?” [laughter] As soon as he sees the car, he’s like, “Whoa. [laughter] What, did you get sideswiped by a semi?” [laughter] I said, “No, my wife calls this a graze. She says– She says you could get it out with some Carnauba wax. I can’t open the door, but she says this is a nine-dollar job. with some Carnauba wax. I can’t yell or scream at the house. I have to suppress all my emotion and feeling into my feet, and I don’t know who I am anymore, but she just says it’s a graze. Uh, I don’t understand why she didn’t see anything. We have sensors and a camera in the vehicle. But, of course, I couldn’t mention that in the heat of the moment or I’d be sleeping outside on the lawn. So, if you could just get out your wax and buff that out, that would be fantastic.” [laughter] [cheering and applause]", "\nSo this guy knows he’s got me. [laughter] He goes into his whole spiel. They always get on one knee. I don’t like when they– they do the one-knee job. [laughter] And then they start talking to themselves, “What the heck? That’s a shame. That’s a shame. [laughter] See, if you would have got hit an inch… [laughter] An inch here… I could have buffed it out. But… [laughter] since your wife hit it where she hit it, I’ve got to remove the quarter panel, I’ve got to take out the trunk, remove the seats, the engine’s got to go…” “What?” [laughter] “Hey, I’m just spitballing here, but 20, 21 grand. I– Don’t quote me on that, I haven’t removed anything, but… that’s what I’m guessing from the start.”", "It’s just different. And now we got a little baby. She’s gonna be one in four days. [cheering] Five days. [applause] A little daughter at home. It’s hard to combine these two different bring-ups. Right? Because my wife has got one view on the world, I’ve got another. Now we’ve got to give this… to this little baby. Right? She don’t know what the hell’s in store for her. [laughter]", "When my wife first got pregnant, everybody was asking us, “Are you gonna take photographs of the belly… [laughter] …and do an announcement? Like, ‘We’re pregnant.’ [laughter] Put it on Facebook… Are you guys gonna do that?” [laughter] I said, “No, we’re just gonna tell people. This is it, she’s pregnant.” [laughter] You see these guys on these pregnancy announcements? The husband’s on his knee, kissing the belly. [laughter] Everybody’s living their life through Facebook. Videos… You’re gonna see it soon. Wedding season is just around the corner. You’re gonna see wedding videos from the wedding… of this choreographed dance that the groom and the groomsmen… Have you– have you seen this? Like, the groom is dancing with the bride, and then, all of a sudden, the lights go up. And then the bride’s like, “What’s going on? [laughter] Oh, my God.” And nine of the groomsmen come out and do a 12 minute… [laughter] …choreographed routine. I– I got married five years ago. I couldn’t get my groomsmen to go get their tuxedos fitted. [laughter] Let alone come to my house and rehearse. [laughter]", "Everybody’s got something, though. ", " on Facebook. There’s always a video, a “Do It Yourself” video, or a life hack. Some guy, 53-year-old guy. He’s got his own channel, he’s in his bathroom with a camera. [laughter] Once a week he comes out with an episode: “What’s up, guys? Welcome to Jim’s Corner. [laughter] Today, I’m gonna teach you how to get that last amount of toothpaste out of your toothpaste tube. [laughter] Simply take a woman’s barrette, attach it to the end of the tube. Now, what you want to do is move the toothpaste near the aperture. Some air is gonna build up in the tube. Take the scissors and let out the…” Go buy another tube, Jim. [laughter] What are you doing in your bathroom… with a bottle of Crest? [laughter]", "So my wife had a nice pregnancy, but when we went to the hospital… I got a little disappointed with the customer service at the ho… We went to the delivery room. I thought this thing was gonna be packed in the delivery room. Sold out. Doctors, nurses, specialists, some interns. Nothing. It’s me, a nurse, and the doctor. And my wife starts going into labor. I go, “Wait, where is everybody?” [laughter] And the doctor’s like, “This is it! Grab a foot.” [laughter] I said, “With all the money we’re paying, we don’t got a… foot guy?” [laughter] I thought I was gonna be up here… for emotional support, rubbing the hair, not in the back with a heel. [laughter] I thought I was gonna make my wife laugh throughout the whole… labor thing. I had– I had a whole set planned. [laughter] We’ve been together nine years. I was planning on doing it, you know, from the first date. Soon as the contractions hit, I went right into the set. I’m like, “Babe, you remember when we first went…” She was like, “Don’t fucking look at me.” Okay. [laughter]", "No one tells you anything. I don’t even have anything on. Nobody gave me like a smock, a hat, a mask. I was in there in a T-shirt and jeans. And I didn’t even know if I was gonna look. But it’s hard not to. My wife’s Jewish. Right? So the baby starts coming out. I saw the head. I saw jet black hair. I’m like, “Babe, I think the Italian penetrated the Jew. I think– [laughter] I think we got an Italian Catholic baby. A little ear came out. That’s when I lost it. As soon as I saw my daughter’s ear come out, I’m like, “Babe, I can’t believe it. This is unbelievable.” And then more head started to come. And then more head. Now I’m like, “What the hell… is wrong… [laughter] …with the head?” [laughter] Nobody told me it comes out like a football. So I’m… [laughter] My wife’s like, “Is she cute?” I’m like, “She’s gonna have some problems in school with the other kids. [laughter] Did you save the receipts for the hats that we bought? They’re not gonna fit on this cone. It’s all fucked up down here. I don’t know what’s going on. Nobody told us. [laughter]", "And it’s– it’s unbelievable to see the actual birth, because they bring the baby out, they bring it out, and then no one told me a bunch of other stuff… [laughter] Just– I got hit in the head with placenta. [laughter] Now we’re in a state of euphoria. I’m like, “Babe, I can’t believe it! We’ve got a daughter, babe!” She’s like, “Go look at her.” So I go to look at her, right, and the doctor is like, “You want to cut the umbilical cord? I’m like, “Again, nobody to do this? [laughter] Isn’t this an important job? And I’m gonna do it with placenta dripping into my eyeball? I mean, it looks like calamari, it shouldn’t be an issue, but… [laughter] Nobody could do this?” [laughter] So then they take the baby back to my wife, and right away, my baby starts breastfeeding, and my wife starts producing milk, right? The other nipple is just shooting… whole milk on the other side of my face. I got placenta, I got milk, I felt like I came out of the canal. I’m– [laughter]", "Now, there’s a moment that you don’t even feel like you’re involved, because the baby’s in on the mother… I’ve got nothing to offer. [laughter] You know? But it hits me, I’m a father. I got responsibility now. We go back to the recovery room and people start coming in, like nurses, and here’s where all the people start coming in. Now, I feel a sense that I have to protect. I feel like a lion in the Serengeti. [laughter] Shedding off predators. [laughter] First woman comes in, she’s like, “Hi, congratulations. I’m here to test your daughter’s hearing.” And my wife’s like, “Oh, yeah, come on in.” I said, “What are you talking about, hearing?” She’s two hours old. What is my daughter gonna do? [laughter] Oh, yeah. [laughter] [mouthing] Wow. That’s loud. Can you turn it down? Turn it down. Turn it down. [laughter] Thank you.", "I’m always very skeptical about what people want, right? Another woman came in, had a big screen TV. She’s like, “We took some beautiful photographs of your daughter, Serafina. Now, for $29.95, you get a glossy 8×10 with a flash drive. I said, “Listen, could you send a link or something? We’re in no condition to be looking at photos. My– my wife’s nipples are bleeding and black tar is coming out of her vagina. Could you come back? I mean, is this the right time? [laughter] We’re gonna need some towels over here and a mop shortly. Because what I’m looking at looks damaged, and I don’t know if we could have a second child based on what I’m looking at. You got a block of ice she could rest this on? [laughter] We’ll look at the pictures next month, but this don’t look normal.” [laughter] My wife looks like somebody threw her out of an airplane. What? [laughter]", "Now, I was dealing with the whole, you know, we got a Jewish baby. My side– my side was like, “What are you gonna do?” [laughter] How are you gonna raise the baby? What are you gonna do? No Christmas? You’re not gonna have a tree?” [laughter] A lot of people deal with this, “Well, you know, her family is more religious than us.” [laughter] So, I’m trying to figure out how I could appease my family. Okay? So, here the woman comes in for the bath. She’s like, “We’re here… to have your daughter, Serafina, for her first bath. I said, “Oh, okay.” I go, “Babe, we’re gonna go.” She goes, “Oh, no, no, no. One parent. Only one parent.” I said, “Okay. Babe, take care of the tar, let me go find out… [laughter] …what’s happening with bath time.” Now, I thought there was gonna be a beautiful porcelain tub. Some candles, dimly-lit, a little Kenny G playing. [laughter] And then it hit me. I was gonna try and sneak a baptism… into the bath. [laughter] I figure if I went to the death floor and found a priest giving last rites, I’ll ask him, “Do you want to come up to Five and baptize the Jewish baby so my mother and father get off my back?” [laughter]", "So, now we take the baby home. Nobody tells you nothing. We’re just gonna figure it out. One month in, baby starts crying. It’s a cry we’ve never heard before. And we do everything as a duet, me and my wife. If the baby’s crying, we get up as a… Feed, we feed together. Everything is a duet. This is not how my father and mother worked it. [laughter] If I was crying, my father, “Go get it! I gotta work!” [laughter] “Do you want to kiss the ba…?” “I don’t want to kiss it! I gotta go to work!” [laughter] But now, 2018, everything’s a couple. We share the duties. [laughter] So, my wife checks the baby. She’s like, “She got a stuffed up nose. Now, babies can’t blow their own nose. I didn’t know this. [laughter] I thought they just… [sneezes] and then, you know… sneeze and shit came out. I’m like, I didn’t know that we had to assist in this. My wife gives me this apparatus. It’s like a bullet you put in the nostril and there’s a hose attached, and you’re at the other end. And I go, “Babe, you want me to… You want me to suck the snot out of her nose and then swallow that? I’ll do it, if that’s what this requires, but shouldn’t we read the box or Google it? I–” [laughter] So, here I am, 3:00 a.m., in my underwear… [laughter] …with the tube up my daughter… [sucking] [laughter] My wife’s like, “What’s wrong?” She goes, “There’s supposed to be a filter.” I go, “There’s no filter. I-I got it… [laughter] I got it right here. I got it right here.” [laughter] Like, who would have known that this would have been it. I mean… I was going back to bed with my wife. I go, “Nine years ago, if I had told you I was gonna be sucking snot out of our daughter’s nose in my underwear, with my left nut hanging out, would you… have still done it? [laughter]", "My wife loves to dress my daughter up. Man, the outfits. I like a onesie. [laughter] It’s easy. Lay the baby in the onesie, tuck the feet in… [laughter] My wife, she’s putting everything… She’s putting skirts, nylons… Babushka. [laughter] You ever dress a baby? My wife told me, “Could you dress her? I’m gonna shower.” I said, “Yeah, no problem.” Shes like, “The clothes are out on the– on the couch. You could dress her.” So as soon as I see the outfit, I get nervous. Did you ever dress an infant? They have no core. So, it’s… [laughter]", "It’s all good. It’s all good, though. Can’t do a lot, though. I mean… My wife loves to do, like, um… Scuba diving, that’s her big thing. Loves to scuba dive. And I don’t do anything where there’s like a safety briefing prior to the activity. [laughter] I don’t want to do anything out of my wheelhouse. First of all, I don’t even know how to swim. I missed that whole thing growing up. [laughter] My grandparents watched us during the week. Now, I had grandparents that lived 52 years in the United States. Not one word of English, nothing. [laughter] And I didn’t speak Italian, so when they watched me, there was a lot of charades, there was a lot of… [laughter] Just a lot of guessing. I just– I just knew they were upset about their health and the way they were feeling. [laughter]", "My grandfather never finished a sentence. He would bust out of the bathroom, and he looked right at me and goes… [speaks indistinctly] [laughter] “I’m sorry, Grandpa. What did you– What did you say?” [speaks indistinctly in Italian] [laughter] “What?” [speaks indistinctly in Italian] “…piss on the floor. The floor… To the right… to the left…” [speaks indistinctly in Italian] [laughter] So, we’re not going to swim class today, Grandpa? I-I-I don’t understand. [laughter] Because we need a letter that states why we did not attend, and from what I’m gathering, your dick is crooked and you’re pissing all over the floor. I don’t even know if they’re gonna accept that excuse on a pizzeria napkin that I wrote because you don’t know the language. [laughter]", "My grandmother had arthritis everywhere, the poor woman. She could barely walk. You could hear her walk from the refrigerator to the sink. From across the house you would hear… [speaks indistinctly in Italian] [laughter] [cheering and applause] So now… I don’t know how to swim. [laughter]", "I didn’t grow up with this type of environment like a lot of American families, you know. When– when the school sent something home, your parents signed it, and that gave you permission to do the field trip or whatever. Right? That didn’t happen in my house. I would come to the school and my whole class wasn’t there. They went to Washington DC… [laughter] …to look at the White House. I’m like, “Where is everybody?” [laughter] They’re like, “Your parents never handed in the permission slip. So… …you, Javier, and Athenos… [laughter] …are gonna be in the lunch room for three days… [laughter] …writing a paper about how immigrant parents don’t sign permission slips.” [laughter]", "Sorry. I don’t want to scuba dive. I think something’s gonna happen if I do that. Right? I’m fearful. If I jump in… …something’s gonna go wrong that they’ve never seen on the boat before. [laughter] There’s gonna be something… [popping sound] “Oh, my God. Tony, have we got another hose?” “No. I thought you brought it.” “No, I didn’t bring it.” And I’m gonna be 400 feet. [laughter] “Bring me up! [laughter] I’m bleeding out of my ears. I knew I shouldn’t have done it.” [laughter]", "My wife grew up in Florida. You know, she grew up on the ocean. So she wants to, like, jet ski or waverun. We rented a WaveRunner once. We just– we got one. She drove and I sat in the “bitch seat”. [laughter] Then a guy comes out, and I’ve got to listen to the guy’s instructions. My wife don’t listen, she’s got no attention span. I’ve got to hone in on the guy. The guy’s like, “Here’s your life vest, man. Put that on.” I said, “Listen, you’ve got to put it on. I can’t put this on. I’m gonna put it on, I’m gonna miss a buckle. The shit’s gonna fly off. You’ve got to do it.” [laughter] He’s like, “Here’s your mouthpiece.” I’m like, “Oh, my God, we could lose our teeth?” [laughter] I look at my wife, she’s got nothing on. I said, “Put on your mouthpiece! [laughter] Put on your mouthpiece. Put on your mouthpiece. We could lose our teeth on this.” [laughter] So there’s four other people that rented WaveRunners. Now the guy’s got to come out and give us the whole spiel. He’s like, “All right, listen, there’s– there’s orange buoys all over the ocean. It’s giving you the perimeter of where you can and cannot go. Now, on the southeast side of the ocean, we spotted some sharks earlier this morning. Stay away from the southeast side.” Now, me, I don’t know southeast. North… I don’t know any of that shit. If you told me right now, what way… I have no idea. I don’t know the compass. [laughter] And I don’t ask, too. If I don’t know something, I don’t ask. If we’re in mixed company, I just– I just ask my wife. -“You know where southeast is?” -“No.” “Okay, we’re gonna get eaten by sharks tonight. Okay? Let’s go. We’re gonna get eaten by sharks because I don’t want to ask the guy, embarrass myself in front of eight people I don’t know because I didn’t pay attention in fifth grade.” [laughter] This guy’s in the middle of his speech. He’s like, “All right, on the north side…” And my wife guns it. She don’t even listen. She’s like… I’m like, “Oh, my God, babe. Go back. Go back. [laughter] It’s rough water, babe. Go back. Slow down, babe. I’m paralyzed, babe. I can’t feel nothing. [laughter] My shoulders are numb, my fingertips. I can’t… I can’t feel nothing, babe. Go back. I’m bleeding, babe, out of my mouth. I– The blood is pooling in my mouthpiece. [laughter] My dick’s in your ass, babe. Get it out. This is– This is a family-friendly beach. [laughter] It’s a family-friendly beach, babe.” [laughter] She just doesn’t know. [laughs]", "Now… We spent some time at the beach. By the time we left, it was dark. ‘Cause we hit a friend’s house on the way home. And we were in my wife’s car. My wife’s car never got gas. [laughter] Every time I get in, I go, “What the f…” [laughter] -I go, “I gotta get–” -“We can make it.” “No, we’ve got four miles left. We’ve got 28 to go. Just do the math.” [laughter] We had to pull over at night at a gas station. My biggest fear, getting murdered… [laughter] …at a gas station, pumping gas. Because we all have our gas stations that we go to. It’s your primary one. You go there and that’s your one. But when you go… out of your neighborhood and you got to pull into some weird one at midnight. Like, when you leave here tonight, if you’re low on gas, you pull into a weird neighborhood you don’t know, you’ve got to be on high alert. [laughter] As soon as you get out of the car, you’ve got to… ask yourself where’s the murder coming from tonight. [laughter] You never give yourself a full tank at night. You give yourself just enough. Two dollars, couple squirts… Let’s keep this thing going. [laughter] Now, this one we pulled in… the credit card machine didn’t work. So, now I’ve got to go in that… that death hut. [laughter] That little mini-mart. You ever go into a mini-mart at midnight? It’s a pit stop for criminals. [laughter] They– they commit crime, and then they stop off to grab a Slurpee… [laughter] …on their way home. [laughter] So, my wife’s in the car. She has no idea the scenario I have created outside the vehicle. [laughter] Now, through the open window, I said to my wife, “Hey. Listen up. [laughter] Dial 911 on that phone. Put your thumb on ‘Send’. Hop in the driver’s seat. Roll all the windows down. If you see me sprint out of the mini-mart, gun it, and I’ll dive in the car.” She’s like, “Oh, my God. What’s…? [laughter] What’s going on?” “I said, ‘I’m going in the mini-mart.’ [laughter] It’s midnight. I could get murdered at any minute out here and you’re playing Words with Friends? Shut it down.” [laughter] You ever approach that– that thing? You don’t even know if it’s open half of the time. You get out of the car and you stop in your tracks. You’re like, “Is this place open?” You’re just looking for a head, something. Somebody taking a Dorito bag, any sign of life in there. [laughter] Then you open the door. You’re sometimes even surprised it opened. [laughter] The floor is always wet. Why is the floor drenched at a gas station at midnight? Are they mopping up from the last murder? Why… [laughter] …is it wet? [laughter] Now, I walk in, right? Stand in line, looking around. For those of you who do Krav Maga, it’s called situational awareness. You look at everything in front of you, trying to figure out what’s happening. Nonverbals. There’s always a guy by the Gatorades, just kind of looking at a Gatorade. [laughter] I’m waiting for him to just reload. [laughter] I’m not getting murdered… at a gas station. I keep to myself. [laughter]", "I was at home a couple months ago, talking to my father about, like, all this stuff, right? And my father had a bunch of mail on the table. Seventy-two years old, the US Mail becomes the focal point of my father’s day. Just everything in just stacks. You ever look at your parents’ mail? I looked at one piece of mail. It said his name. It said, “Salvatore None Maniscalco.” I said, “Dad, what is this?” He goes, “Yeah, on the application, they asked me for my middle name. I put ‘None’.” [laughter] “What? [laughter] What did you do?” [laughter] He wanted to come over and help me with the… there was a construction job, right? But my dad doesn’t know, you know, I got like a contractor that I got doing this stuff. He’s like, “I’ll come and help you.” I go, “Dad, that’s all right, you know. You forget, you’re 72. What are you gonna do?” I wish I– I wish I knew how to do it. There’s guys in here that know how to build. I’ve got buddies like this. They build, like, a deck on the weekend. [laughter] You go to their house and they’re always like: -“You want to see the deck I built?” -“You built a deck? When?” “Today.” “Today? I took a nap. You built a whole deck?” [laughter] You know guys like this, flatbed F-150? [laughter] Sawdust. Got a shed in the back. Out of wood. I don’t– I don’t do any of this. I gotta hire– I gotta hire a contractor. And this guy could tell me anything, I’d believe him. Every morning he comes down, it’s a different thing. He’s like, “Sebastian, can I talk to you for a second? In my 38 years of contracting, I’ve never seen anything like this. [laughter] The wall, see? It’s a wall. The wall. There’s– There’s a bend in the wall. Come on. Feel it, feel the bend.” Like an idiot, I’m like, “Okay, I’ll feel the bend.” [laughter] -“I don’t really feel it.” -“Well, it’s there. We can leave it. It’s entirely up to you. We can leave this wall as is. But when you’re watching the game on Sunday, the house could fall down on your family. [laughter] You tell me.” [laughter]", "You ever get a contractor to work at your house? They’ll do the job… They start it, they get a bigger job. Now they pull their whole crew, they work the bigger job, bigger money. Now, you’re sitting there. Nobody. I got no floor, no ceiling. Nothing. [laughter] They send one guy. After five days, one guy comes strolling in. Relaxed, right? He comes strolling in. “Hey.” -“So, where is everybody?” -“I don’t know. I’m here to sweep from side to side. [laughter] Dan told me there’s a lot of dust. I got to sweep it.” [laughter] “I’ve got– I’ve no floor. I– [laughter] What are you guys gonna do here with the floor?” “Oh, with the floor? He told me… [mutters indistinctly] [laughter] He told me he’s gonna put the chingadera on the side… the chingadera. [laughter] What do you know?” I go, “Chingadera”, I’ve never even seen that… [laughter] …in the architectural drawing. I don’t know what you’re talking about. “No, he told me to put the chingadera on the side and tighten it. You know? But I don’t have it, ’cause I don’t got my truck, I got my Ford Festiva. You– You got to go to Home Depot. Eh… [laughter] You gotta go to Home Depot.” [laughter] You ever go to Home Depot? Man, that store… I don’t– I don’t fit in. I don’t even have the wardrobe to walk in there. That’s a lot of brown, beige, boots. Pencil tucked behind the ear, tape measures hanging… Everybody’s measuring… at Home Depot. [laughter] “How much you need? A quarter-eighth of an inch?” [laughter] I don’t know nothing over there. I gotta ask questions. I found a woman that worked there. I’m like, “I’m so sorry, sweetheart, to bother you, but, uh, I’ve been here for two hours. I’m, uh… I’m looking for a chingadera for the side.” [laughter] “No, he told me it was a chingadera for the side. You don’t have that here?”", "You guys have been great. This has been… [cheering and applause] …one fantastic evening. Thank you so… so much, New York City. Thank you up there… in the three tiers. Thank you.", "[instrumental music plays]"], "url": "https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2019/01/29/sebastian-maniscalco-stay-hungry-transcript/"}
